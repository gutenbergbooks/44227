<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>FOREWORD</p>

<p>It will probably come as a surprise to many
readers to know that when this story was written,
more than one hundred American newspapers
owned and operated airplanes as a regular part of
their news-gathering equipment. By the time
this tale is between covers, there will doubtless be
many additional planes cleaving the skies in the
swift search for news, in the carrying of relief to
marooned and endangered human beings, in the
hunt for those who are lost, in the transportation
of news photographs, and not infrequently in the
carrying of important papers and documents.
For although the primary end of the newspaper
is to collect and distribute news, it also carries on
a host of activities for the direct benefit of
mankind.</p>

<p>Some of these news planes are elaborately
equipped for their work, with desks and typewriters
for reporters, darkrooms and developing
equipment for photographers, and special
equipment for the taking of aerial photographs. Some
of these planes ordinarily carry as many as four
men—a pilot, a mechanic, a camera man, and a
reporter. Thus they are equipped for almost
any emergency.</p>

<p>Among the eight airplanes used by the Hearst
newspaper forces to “cover” the arrival of the
<span class='it'>Graf Zeppelin</span> on the Pacific Coast were some
huge tri-motored ships. One of these was
equipped like a real news room. It carried one
reporter, one photographer, one announcer, one
radio operator and technician. The plane flew
two hundred miles along the coast, and sent descriptive
stories direct by radio to the <span class='it'>Examiner</span>
office in Los Angeles, where a short-wave station
copied the despatches and rushed them to the
editors at their desks.</p>

<p>It would be easy enough to “invent” adventures
for news fliers, but it would be foolish to do
so for the reason that few “made-up” stories
could equal in interest the actual experiences of
flying reporters. Consequently, practically all
the material in this book is based upon actual
occurrences.</p>

<p>The bit of Warren Long’s parachute that
Jimmy Donnelly prized so highly is merely the
counterpart of a piece of the parachute of that
fine young pilot, the late Thomas Nelson. It is
from the parachute he had when he stepped out
of a burning mail plane at Ringtown, Pa., in the
fall of 1929. This keepsake was given to me by
Dr. Leigh Breisch, of Lewisburg, Pa., with
whose father Pilot Nelson spent several hours
after that thrilling leap. His parachute was
partly burned, and the bit of silk in my possession
is scorched by fire. It is a prized possession, for
I knew and greatly admired the dauntless young
man who wore it.</p>

<p>The descriptions of the radio beacons are as
accurate as the writer can make them. The installation
of these beacons marks a great step
forward in the development of flying. Radio
beacons are being erected as fast as possible along
the entire transcontinental airway, and will also
be used to guide befogged fliers on other routes.</p>

<p>In the course of this story Jimmy Donnelly
awakens a sleeping family whose home was afire,
by diving at the house and making as much noise
with his plane as possible. On various occasions
Air Mail pilots have done exactly this thing.
That excellent flier and former Air Mail pilot,
Paul Collins, is one of the airmen who performed
this trick.</p>

<p>Covering floods, scouting out the marooned and
helpless, and making aerial surveys of districts
suffering from great calamities, is a commonplace
among news fliers. Time and again they
have carried food and medicine and clothing, and
even newspapers, to persons marooned in floods
or on ice-blocked islands or on stranded ships.
In this story Jimmy Donnelly transports the
stereotype matrixes from a flooded newspaper
office to another newspaper plant miles distant,
where the stereotype plates are cast and the edition
printed. This thing actually happened in
the Middle West, when a flier took the “mats”
of the Hutchinson (Kans.) <span class='it'>News and Herald</span>
to the plant of the Wichita <span class='it'>Eagle</span>, where the
papers were printed and then rushed back by
plane to Hutchinson for distribution in that
city.</p>

<p>Many of the incidents pictured in the chapter
about the New Hampshire flood are actual occurrences.</p>

<p>Incredible though it may seem, even the affair
with the bootlegger, in which Jimmy Donnelly
is forced to fly a rum runner to Canada, actually
happened. Shirley Short, former Air Mail pilot
and flier for the Chicago <span class='it'>Daily News</span>, told me the
story. Hamilton Lee, piloting a plane for the
Chicago <span class='it'>Tribune</span>, transported food to folks marooned
on an island in Lake Michigan. A bootlegger,
flying over the island at the same time,
broke a connecting rod bearing and got down
safely, although his engine was torn half out of
his plane. He clapped a pistol to Lee’s head and
forced Lee to carry him the rest of the way to the
mainland. For the purpose of this story it was
necessary to transfer the incident to Lake Ontario,
but that does not alter the essential truthfulness
of the tale.</p>

<p>The fact is that almost everything in this book
is based upon an actual occurrence, or was suggested
to me by fliers as the result of their experiences.
I mention this fact because, although this
book is purely a piece of fiction, the purpose of
the book is to show the part that fliers play in
news coverage. Hence it had to be truthful in
essence.</p>

<p>For material and other assistance, the writer is
indebted to many persons connected with the
business of flying. In particular I wish to express
my indebtedness to Pilot Warren J. White,
of Albany, who “flew” the New York <span class='it'>Times</span>
from Albany to Lake Placid. Mr. White has
had years of experience as pilot and manager of
flying enterprises. He supplied much material,
suggested many situations and incidents for this
book, and finally checked the manuscript for inaccuracies
and “touched up” the flying technique
to give that part of the story a truly professional
air. To Mr. C. G. Andrus, chief of the Eastern
Division of the Airways Weather Bureau, I have
long been indebted for information concerning
the work of the forecasters in aiding pilots. To
these men and to many others who have assisted
me in the work of collecting material for flying-stories,
I wish to express my hearty thanks.</p>

<p>News fliers do the most remarkable things and
have the most wonderful adventures. But like
most other things connected with the business of
collecting news, these adventures are seldom
heard of excepting in newspaper or flying circles.
If this story makes these achievements more evident
to readers, the writer will be gratified.</p>

<p>Jimmy Donnelly had just arrived at
the hangar at the Long Island flying field
where his plane was housed. To be sure, the
plane really wasn’t Jimmy’s, because it belonged
to the New York <span class='it'>Morning Press</span>; but Jimmy
was its pilot, and had flown it ever since that
great newspaper had decided that it must have
a plane of its own. And Jimmy had piloted it
so long, and had taken such loving care of it, that
he felt as though it were his very own. Indeed,
he could not have lavished more attention on the
plane if it <span class='it'>had</span> been his own. He was forever
polishing and cleaning it, and checking over the
engine, and keeping it tuned up to concert pitch.</p>

<p>But just now Jimmy was not thinking about
his plane. The morning mail lay before him on
the table in the little hangar office. There were
the daily papers, some circulars, and several letters.
Jimmy had already slit the letters open.
The one he picked out of the bunch was a rather
bulky letter that bore, in the upper left hand
corner, this return address: Warren Long, Hadley
Airport, New Brunswick, N. J. But Jimmy
did not need to read this return address to know
from whom the letter came. He recognized the
handwriting instantly. That was why he selected
this letter in preference to any other letter, to
read first.</p>

<p>He knew perfectly well that it was from his old
friend Warren Long, dean of Air Mail fliers, the
pilot who had helped him to get into the U. S.
Air Mail Service as a “grease monkey,” and who
had afterward assisted him up the ladder, rung
by rung, until he, Jimmy, had attained his present
enviable position as a flying reporter for the
New York <span class='it'>Morning Press</span>.</p>

<p>Jimmy wondered why Warren Long had written
to him. He opened the envelope eagerly.</p>

<p>Out dropped what looked like a white silk handkerchief.
Jimmy was more puzzled than ever.
With growing curiosity he pulled the letter from
the envelope, spread it out on his desk, and read
as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p><span class='sc'>Dear Jimmy:</span></p>

<p>Last night I had occasion to join the Caterpillar
Club. It is odd how a fellow’s brain works
at such times. As I was on my way to the
ground I thought of you. Why I should think
of you at such a time I do not know. But I did,
and I said to myself, “Jimmy would like a piece
of this parachute. He’s always collecting souvenirs.”
So when I got my feet on solid ground
once more, I cut a piece of silk out of the ’chute,
which was already badly torn by the bushes, and
here it is. You may like to add it to your
museum.</p>

<p>I suppose you’ll read in the daily paper about
my losing the mail. I’m all cut up about it. This
is the first cargo I ever lost in ten years of flying
the mail. I tried to save it, but it was impossible.
You see, my plane somehow caught fire. I tried
to extinguish the flames; but the fire must have
been in the crank-case or somewhere where the
extinguisher fluid couldn’t touch it. Then I tried
to reach the nearest emergency landing field; but
my engine went dead. The flames were spreading
fast and shooting back into the cockpit in
sheets. There was nothing to do but step out.
My, how I hated to abandon the mail. But I
had no choice. So I disconnected my head phones
from the instrument board, picked up my flashlight,
and stepped out.</p>

<p>The instant I did so the plane turned on her
side and dived straight after me. It was interesting
to watch it. I was evidently falling head
down, for I could see everything without even
turning my eyes. My ship plunged like a rocket
stick. She was just one long streak of fire. I
thought sure she was going to hit me. I tried to
crowd over and get out of the way. You can’t
imagine what a funny, helpless feeling a fellow
has when he can’t touch anything with either his
hands or his feet. Anyway, the ship just grazed
me, but a miss is as good as a mile. The instant
she was past I started to pull the rip-cord. I
found my flash-light was in my right hand. I
had to shift it to my left hand. That didn’t take
very long, but I was then so near the ground that
every second counted. I made the shift and gave
the rip-cord a quick jerk. It wasn’t a moment
too soon, either. While I was floating down the
rest of the way to the earth I thought of you.</p>

<p>While I was still in the air, my ship hit with a
terrific explosion. It was utterly consumed.
Everything about it was burned. Much of the
metal was melted by the terrible heat. The place
where I came down was nearly half a mile from
the spot where the ship landed. There was a
thick woods between me and the ship. I could
see the glare of the fire plainly, and I hurried
right over to the spot. A lad from the neighborhood
helped me. Some farmers were already
there.</p>

<p>I am sending this bit of my ’chute for <span class='it'>you</span> to
add to your collection, as I said, and I also write
to tell you that if you ever have to step out of
your ship at night, be sure to take your flashlight.
I found mine more than useful. For I
landed in a scrub patch on a hillside. It was
rough country and I was far from being at my
best. But with the aid of my flash-light and the
help of the lad I mentioned I had no trouble in
getting to my plane, and later in reaching a town.</p>

<p>I hope everything is going well with you. The
best of luck to you.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'>Ever your friend,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:0em;'>Warren Long.</p>

</div>

<p>Jimmie stared at the letter incredulously. For
a moment he was silent. Then, “Thank God
Warren wasn’t hurt!” he cried. “I wonder
where it happened. And I wonder where
Warren is now. And how in time did he get that
letter to me so quickly?”</p>

<p>For a time Jimmy was silent, thinking the matter
over. Presently he thought he had solved the
problem. “Warren left Hadley with the 9:35&nbsp;p.&nbsp;m.
section of the mail,” he muttered. “The
fire probably occurred before he had been flying
more than an hour or so. He was likely near
some town where he could catch a late train, and
he probably got back to Hadley early this morning.
He must have written this note at once and
got it into a mail for New York. It was mighty
quick work, no matter how he did it. And it was
just like Warren Long. He wanted to tell me
about the flash-light and was afraid he would
never think to mention it when he saw me. Gee!
I am sure glad to have this piece of his ’chute.
You bet I’ll put it in my ‘museum,’ as he calls
my little collection of aviation keepsakes. Who
wouldn’t be glad to have a piece of Warren
Long’s parachute?”</p>

<p>Jimmy picked up the little square of silk and
smoothed it lovingly. The fabric was creamy
white, beautifully woven, with a lovely sheen. It
was thin and delicate and almost gauzy in effect,
and one could hardly believe that so delicate a
fabric could possibly have withstood the terrific
strain imposed upon it when it suddenly opened
by Warren Long’s two hundred pounds—for
with his heavy flying suit and the ’chute pack
itself, the pilot must easily have weighed as much
as that.</p>

<p>In one corner of the square of silk was a dark,
scorched space.</p>

<p>“Gee!” said Jimmy. “That fire was a lot
nearer getting Warren Long than he intimated.
But that is like him. He would hardly have
mentioned it if he had had a leg burned off. If
his parachute got scorched like that, he certainly
had a close call himself. I know that, all right.”</p>

<p>Jimmy spread the square of silk on his desk
and smoothed it out with his hand. It had evidently
been roughly and hastily cut from the
parachute. The edges were jagged and uneven.
“I’ll get some woman to trim these edges and
overcast them,” thought Jimmy. “Then the silk
can’t unravel. And if I ever <span class='it'>should</span> want to use
it as a handkerchief, I could.”</p>

<p>A sudden thought came to him. Hastily he
folded and thrust the bit of silk into the envelope.
Then he reached for the <span class='it'>Morning Press</span>.</p>

<p>“I wonder what the paper says about the affair,”
he muttered.</p>

<p>The item he was searching for Jimmy found
on the front page, near the bottom of column
six. It was a brief story, hardly three inches
long, telling how Long’s plane had caught fire
and how the pilot had jumped from the burning
ship, after finding that he could not extinguish
the blaze. Jimmy read the story and frowned.</p>

<p>“Some country correspondent who doesn’t
know a good story when he sees one sent that in,”
growled Jimmy, indignantly. “Why, it’s evident
from Warren’s letter that he had a most
startling experience, with that flaming ship diving
straight at him, while he was utterly powerless
to help himself. That’s great human interest
stuff. It ought to be good for half a column
any day. And if we had the details, I’ll bet
there’d be a front page spread in it.”</p>

<p>With Jimmy, to think was to act. He reached
for the telephone.</p>

<p>“Please give me the <span class='it'>Morning Press</span>,” he told
the telephone operator.</p>

<p>A moment later he was talking to the city
editor of that paper.</p>

<p>“Mr. Davis,” he said, “I have just been reading
the story about Warren Long’s parachute
jump last night. I have had a note from Warren
Long, too. It seems that when he stepped out of
the burning plane he fell head first, and in that
position he watched the plane as he dropped. The
ship turned over almost as soon as he stepped out
of her and dived straight at him, like a flaming
arrow. Warren didn’t dare open his ’chute for
fear the plane would foul it and he would be
killed. So he just kept on falling head first,
watching the blazing plane as it tore after him,
and hoping the thing would pass him clean and
in time. For he wasn’t very high up when he
jumped. The ship barely missed him as it shot
by. The instant it was past, Warren yanked his
rip-cord, and it wasn’t a moment too soon, either.
The ’chute opened and kept him up in the air
for a few seconds, while the ship hit the ground
with a tremendous explosion. The fire that
followed was terrific. Fortunately, the wind blew
Warren well to one side. But he must have been
burned some before he jumped, for he sent me a
bit of his parachute, and the silk is badly
scorched.”</p>

<p>“Do you know where Warren Long is now?”
asked the city editor.</p>

<p>“No, sir. But I suspect he came back to
Hadley Airport on a train, and is probably at his
home in Plainfield.”</p>

<p>“The story we printed is an A. P. despatch,”
said Mr. Davis. “All the papers will have it.
Likely that is all the story any of them will carry.
We ought to be able to get a good exclusive
follow-up story. I’ll send a man over to Hadley
to get into touch with Long and get all the details
from him. Meantime, I wish you would fly
over to Ringtown, where the crash occurred, get
all the facts you can there, and take pictures of
the burned plane, the spot where the plane
crashed, and anything else that will help the
story.”</p>

<p>“All right, Mr. Davis. I’ll be off as soon as
I can get my plane warmed up. Be sure to tell
the man you send to see Warren Long that I
want Warren to give him the whole story. Otherwise
he won’t talk. But he’ll do anything for
me. Good-bye. I’m off.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>CHAPTER II</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:1.0em;'>A Flight in Quest of News</p>

<p>Fairly atremble with eagerness, Jimmy ran
out into the hangar and made a rapid inspection
of his plane, to see that everything was
right. He glanced at the wheels, to see that the
chocks were in front of them, then scrambled into
the cabin and touched the starter. His engine
answered with a roar. Jimmy throttled it down
until it was idling gently. For a moment he sat
listening to it. Then, satisfied, he climbed out
of the ship, and set about completing his preparations
for the task ahead of him.</p>

<p>Had Jimmy been a little more experienced in
newspaper work he would not have been so excited
about this simple assignment that Mr. Davis had
given him. All he had to do was to fly a hundred
miles or so, gather a few facts, take a few pictures,
and get back as quickly as possible. But
there was no need to hurry, as there would have
been had it been late in the day. Nevertheless,
Jimmy was all atingle with enthusiasm and eagerness.
He could hardly wait to be at his task.</p>

<p>Jimmy had always been like that about anything
in which he was interested. He put his
whole soul into whatever he was doing. Doubtless
he owed his present job to that very fact.
For after he had lost his place as a reserve mail
pilot, when Uncle Sam quit flying the mails,
Jimmy had really created this present job for
himself. He had told Mr. Tom Johnson, the
managing editor of the <span class='it'>Morning Press</span>, that that
newspaper ought to have its own plane and its
own pilot. And when Mr. Johnson said that that
was the last thing the <span class='it'>Morning Press</span> needed,
Jimmy had decided to prove to Mr. Johnson that
the newspaper really <span class='it'>did</span> need a plane and a pilot
even though the managing editor thought otherwise.
Jimmy proved his point by volunteering
to execute two difficult commissions for the
<span class='it'>Morning Press</span> and then by succeeding in each
commission. And in each case he owed his success
to his enthusiasm, his whole-hearted devotion to
his task, and his refusal to be defeated. In each
case perseverance had won for him.</p>

<p>First, he had volunteered to find Warren Long,
when that veteran pilot was lost in “the graveyard
of airplanes,” as the mail pilots call that
vast and terrible mountain wilderness in western
Pennsylvania. And he had found him, after all
other searchers had been baffled. He had found
him disabled by a broken leg, in the path of an
advancing forest fire, after a terrible forced landing.
The story of that adventure is told in “The
Search for the Lost Mail Plane.” Thus, for the
second time, Jimmy had saved the life of this
brother pilot that he loved so well. The first time
was when Warren Long’s plane fell into the
Susquehanna River immediately in front of
Jimmy’s home, and Jimmy had swum out in the
icy water and rescued the unconscious pilot. The
account of that rescue is given in “Piloting the U. S. Air
Mail,” That occurrence marked the
beginning of the devoted friendship between this
older pilot and the youthful Jimmy. So it is easy
to see why Warren Long sent a bit of his parachute
to Jimmy, who was interested in collecting
such things, and why Jimmy told his city editor
that Warren Long would do anything for him.</p>

<p>The second commission that Jimmy had executed
for the <span class='it'>Morning Press</span> was the running
down of a gang of robbers after one of them had
looted a mail plane that had crashed one stormy
night in this selfsame “graveyard of airplanes.”
The story of that thief chase is told in “Trailing
the Air Mail Bandit.” It was a long, hard chase,
too; and one which Jimmy would never have won
had it not been for these very same qualities of
enthusiasm, determination, and perseverance.
For in this case Jimmy had had to work against
the greatest obstacles and the most incredible
discouragements.</p>

<p>In both cases he won; and his success did far
more than merely clear up two mysteries. It
convinced Mr. Johnson that Jimmy was right
when he argued that the <span class='it'>Morning Press</span> ought to
add a flier to its staff. Mr. Johnson added one;
and quite naturally he chose Jimmy. Thus it
was that Jimmy’s job, like his plane, was brand-new.</p>

<p>Although Jimmy had handled these two big
stories successfully, though of course he had considerable
help, he didn’t feel any too sure of
himself yet as a reporter. For during the short
time that he had been a regular member of the
<span class='it'>Morning Press</span> staff, there had been few stories
on which Jimmy could work. Mostly he had been
doing tasks of the fetch-and-carry sort. He had
transported pictures and camera men and reporters.
But he had had little opportunity for
independent news gathering. Hence he welcomed
this present chance with such eagerness.</p>

<p>But even though Jimmy was not yet a seasoned
reporter, there was one quality he possessed that
made up for much that he still lacked. He had a
naturally keen news sense. He was gifted with
what newspaper men call a “nose for news.” He
felt the dramatic possibilities in everything he
heard and saw. He seemed to sense the facts that
should be secured in order to make the most of a
story. That was why he at once saw that the tale
in the morning paper about Warren Long was
faulty, that the correspondent had failed to
secure the dramatic elements in the story that
would appeal most to people. That was why
Jimmy knew there was a real human interest
story in this thrilling leap from a burning plane.
It was this keen news sense that now made Jimmy
so eager to get the facts—the significant facts—that
the correspondent had failed to secure.
Jimmy wanted to make good. He wanted to help
his paper “scoop” all the other newspapers in
New York. He believed he could do it. That
was why he was all atremble with eagerness. Like
a race-horse at the barrier, he was restive and
impatient to go.</p>

<p>But though Jimmy was green in the newspaper
game, he was well seasoned in the flying
business. He had had too much experience to
take anything for granted. Hence, while his
plane was warming up, Jimmy made sure that
he was prepared for any emergency. He saw to
it that his flash-light was in its place and in good
working order. That was the first thing he
thought of. In future it would always be the
first thing he thought of. Warren Long’s letter
had made an indelible impression on his mind.
He saw that the plane contained a little case of
emergency rations that he habitually carried. He
made sure his pistol was in place. That was a
piece of equipment most fliers lacked. Mail pilots
are compelled to carry pistols, and Jimmy had
formed the habit of flying armed, while he was in
the mail service. Experience had shown him the
wisdom of having a firearm at hand in his ship.
He made sure that he had his topographic maps
and other articles that he had found to be necessary
or desirable. Of course he put his camera
aboard, with a plentiful supply of films.</p>

<p>After a final close inspection of the plane,
Jimmy put on his ’chute and snapped it fast.
Then he climbed into the cabin, glanced at the
instruments, held the stick back, and shoved the
throttle forward. No longer was there the staccato
of exploding gases, but instead a thundering
roar. Jimmy kept her wide open while he noted
the maximum number of revolutions his propeller
was making, his oil temperature and oil pressure.
Then he switched from one “mag” to the other,
but noticed no difference in “revs.” Gradually
Jimmy throttled her down to a murmur. She
was perfect!</p>

<p>An attendant came forward and pointed to the
chocks. Jimmy nodded “O. K.” As the attendant
pulled the chocks from the wheels, Jimmy
glanced at the wind-sock on his hangar. Then he
taxied slowly down the field. He headed into the
wind and gave her full gun. The ship accelerated
rapidly. With a thundering roar the ship took
off gracefully, guided by an experienced hand
and brain. Jimmy was off on his assignment.</p>

<p>He cut over to the very edge of Long Island
and followed the southern shore-line. Over the
Bay and across the southern end of Staten Island
he winged his way, heading south of west, to pick
up the route of the Air Mail. Long before he
crossed the Delaware, near Easton, he was right
on the line. How much like old times it seemed,
to be flying over the beacon lights. To be sure,
they were not flashing now, in the morning light,
but he knew where the towers were and he saw
each one as he flew over it, where it stood like a
friendly sentinel, to point out the path.</p>

<p>In the clear light of day Jimmy had no need
of guide-posts or flashing lights or radio signals.
He knew the route as well as a schoolboy knows
the way to the high school. But Jimmy’s plane
was equipped with radio, and ear phones were
built into his flying helmet. Presently he
“plugged in” to his instrument board to see if
he could pick up the weather. That is a topic of
constant interest to every flier. He had barely
passed Numidia before he heard the Bellefonte
radio man sending out his hourly weather report.
“This is station WWQ, Airways Communication
Station, Bellefonte, Pa., broadcasting
weather information on the Chicago-New York
airway. It is now 10 A. M. Eastern Standard
Time. At Hadley Field, N. J., scattered clouds,
ceiling unlimited, visibility eight miles, wind
south, nine miles, temperature 50, dewpoint 29,
barometer 29.98; Allentown, Pa., scattered
clouds, ceiling unlimited, visibility seven miles,
wind southeast, four miles, temperature 51, barometer
29.94. Park Place, Pa., broken clouds,
ceiling estimated four thousand, visibility ten
miles, wind southeast, fourteen miles, temperature
45, barometer 29.89; Sunbury, Pa., overcast
light haze, ceiling estimated twenty-five hundred,
visibility four miles, wind calm, temperature 50,
barometer 29.81; Numidia, Pa., overcast light
haze, occasional sprinkles of rain, ceiling twenty-four
hundred, visibility three miles, wind southwest,
five miles, temperature 49, barometer 29.79.
This concludes the broadcast of weather information
from station WWQ, Bellefonte, Pa.”</p>

<p>“That sounds good to me,” thought Jimmy.
“I ought to get over to Ringtown and back to
Long Island without having to face any bad
weather. I’m certainly glad of it, for I’ll have
enough trouble as it is.”</p>

<p>He flew on, his head phones still plugged in.
Sounding endlessly he could hear the steady
stroke of the Air Mail radio beacon sending a
string of dashes—“dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah,”
which tells the pilot when he is exactly on the line.
Jimmy had small need of any such help this
morning, for the air was so clear that he could
see for miles in every direction. But he thought
of the invaluable help this radio beacon must be
to the mail pilots in the fog. The device had been
perfected since Jimmy was a mail pilot. He had
never carried mail under its guidance. But he
was as well equipped to profit by it as any mail
pilot was. More than once he had been helped in
bad weather by this very same signal, as he flew
along the mail route.</p>

<p>In a sense he was helped now. A little breeze
had been coming up, that blew across the line of
flight. Jimmy was being blown to one side, without
realizing it. Of course he would presently
have noticed that fact anyway, and brought his
ship back to the line, but the signal in his ears
gave him prompt warning. No longer did he
hear the steady beat: “dah, dah, dah, dah, dah,
dah.” Instead, the head phones were saying:
“dot dah, dot dah, dot dah, dot dah, dot dah.”
The radio signal had changed to dot dash, dot
dash. That told Jimmy that he was to the left
of the line. He knew that if he had chanced to
be on the right side of the line instead, the signals
would have changed to dash dot, dash dot, and
his head phones would have said: “dah dot, dah
dot, dah dot, dah dot.” He nosed his ship a little
into the wind, and presently he was right over
the line once more, and the head phones again
were singing: “dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.”</p>

<p>“Gee,” thought Jimmy, “if only they had had
the radio beacon from the start, how very many
tragedies the Air Mail would have been saved.
It’s fine for the men who are carrying the mail
now. They always know when they are on the
line, even if it is so foggy they can’t see a thing.
If it just weren’t for these old Pennsylvania
mountains, flying the eastern leg of the Air Mail
would be pie. But I guess this leg will always
be a graveyard. Hello, here’s Ringtown. I’ve
got to be thinking about getting down.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>CHAPTER III</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:1.0em;'>Jimmy Meets an Old Friend—Johnnie Lee, of the Wireless Patrol</p>

<p>For many miles—ever since he crossed the
Delaware into Pennsylvania, in fact, Jimmy
had been flying over a region so rough and
rugged that it strikes terror to the heart of the
aviator. For here Nature has plowed up the land
in rugged furrows that rise thousands of feet. In
places the earth is jumbled in confused masses.
Rocks, trees, precipices, bogs, and deep ravines
characterize the whole countryside. Rare, indeed,
is the level spot that is large enough, or smooth
enough, or firm enough to permit a safe landing.
And well Jimmy knew what awaited him or any
other aviator who was luckless enough to be
forced down in this terrible region. And yet this
country was tame beside that of the “graveyard
of airplanes” in the western half of the state.
It was here, when he was fairly in the heart of
these terrible mountains, that Warren Long had
found his plane afire. As Jimmy looked down
now at the torn and jagged face of the country,
he fairly shivered when he thought of the terrible
situation in which his friend had been placed
such a short time previously. For it was obviously
impossible to land a plane safely in these
ragged hills, especially in the dark; and to Jimmy
it seemed almost as dangerous to trust to a parachute.
For there was no way by which the falling
flier could tell when he was about to land with
a crash on a rock, or a jagged stump, or in the
splintering arms of a pine-tree—no way, it came
to Jimmy as an afterthought, unless he carried
a flash-light powerful enough to pierce the blackness
of the night. And Jimmy felt again that
same feeling of gratitude to Uncle Sam that he
had felt many a time previously for the little
emergency landing fields along the lighted airway
that the Government has spied out and marked
off with encircling lights at night, where aviators
in distress can land in safety.</p>

<p>It was one of these emergency fields—that at
Ringtown—which Warren Long had been striving
to reach on the preceding night. And it was
this same field that Jimmy was now heading for.</p>

<p>Jimmy had been flying rather high. Gently
pulling back the throttle, he went into a steep
spiral. At about eight hundred feet he straightened
up while he glanced at the wind-sock.
“Bang” went the gun again, and Jimmy flew
around the edge of the field into the wind. The
field was none too large. Tall trees on the lee
side of it called for plenty of energetic side-slipping
and fish-tailing. Jimmy straightened her
out, held her off to lose flying speed, and as soon
as he felt the wheels touch hauled back on the
stick and stepped on his brakes. Jimmy breathed
a sigh of relief and thanked his lucky stars for
those brakes, for the ship came to rest within
twenty-five feet of a stone fence. In another
moment he was taxiing safely across the field
toward the beacon light tower, where a knot of
men and boys had gathered, waiting for Jimmy’s
ship to come to rest.</p>

<p>Jimmy throttled down his engine to let it idle
for a few minutes so the valves could cool before
he “cut his switch.” He stepped to the ground.
The little company of spectators surged toward
him.</p>

<p>“Can any one of you tell me——” began
Jimmy. Then he stopped short and gazed at
one of the group in silent astonishment. “Well,
where in the world did you come from, Johnnie
Lee?” he demanded, after a moment. And he
stepped quickly toward a sturdy lad who stood
somewhat behind the other spectators. “I
haven’t seen you for ages—not since I left home
to learn to fly, in fact.”</p>

<p>“Jimmy!” cried the lad, rushing forward with
outstretched hand. “I didn’t know you at first,
with your helmet on. I’m awfully glad to see
you.” And he fairly wrung Jimmy’s hand.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?” demanded
Jimmy, when they had finished shaking hands.</p>

<p>“I might ask you the same question,” laughed
Johnnie. “I am here because I can’t very well
help it. My father’s health broke down, and the
doctor said he would have to get into the country.
We have relatives close by named Healy. So
Dad bought a little farm here. I’ve been at home,
doing most of the farming. You are the first
member of the old Wireless Patrol I have seen
since we moved down here. My! It’s been tough
to be separated from all the gang. I think of the
old days often, and of the fine times we used to
have when we were in camp at Fort Brady.”</p>

<p>“They were good old days, weren’t they, Johnnie?”
said Jimmy. “How the old crowd has
gotten separated. There’s Alec Cunningham
down in New Jersey in the oyster business, and
Roy Mercer a wireless operator on an ocean
steamer, and Bob Martin in the Lighthouse
Service, and Henry Harper in the Coast Guard.
My, it doesn’t seem possible that the old crowd
could be scattered so. Can you tell me about
any of the other fellows of the Wireless Patrol?”</p>

<p>“I can tell you a whole lot about Jimmy Donnelly,”
laughed Johnnie.</p>

<p>“How’s that?” demanded Jimmy. “What
do you know about me and how did you find it
out?”</p>

<p>“You don’t think anybody could have all the
adventures you have had, finding lost air mail
pilots and rounding up robbers and not have
people know about it, do you? Why, I read
about those things in the newspaper.”</p>

<p>“That reminds me,” said Jimmy, “that I am
here now for the <span class='it'>Morning Press</span>, to get more
details about Warren Long’s parachute jump last
night. You can’t tell me anything about it, can
you?”</p>

<p>“I certainly can,” said Johnnie, “for I saw
the whole thing happen, and the pilot landed
right on our farm and I helped him get back to
his burning ship to try to save some of the mail.”</p>

<p>“Well, if that isn’t luck,” said Jimmy. “Take
me to the burned plane, will you, and tell me
what you know about the affair.”</p>

<p>“All right. Come along,” and Johnnie led the
way toward a clearing on the slope of a hill at
some little distance.</p>

<p>The way was rough, for they had to pass over
some stony fields and through a patch of timber.
They had ample time to talk as they walked.</p>

<p>“How did you happen to see Warren Long’s
burning plane?” asked Jimmy.</p>

<p>“I was looking for it.”</p>

<p>“Looking for it! What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Just what I say. I was looking for it, though
I had no idea it was going to be afire. You see,
ever since you got into the Air Mail, Jimmy, I
have been interested in the mail planes. I have
always hoped that one of them would land here.
And as long as you were a mail pilot I guess I
was always hoping that you would be piloting the
ship that stopped here. Well, I got so much
interested in the mail planes that I kept right on
watching for them, even after you left the service.
You know the first night mail plane always comes
over here just about bedtime, and I almost always
step out-of-doors and watch it sail over.”</p>

<p>“I know how you feel,” said Jimmy.</p>

<p>“Well,” continued Johnnie, “when I heard
the mail plane coming last night I stepped outside
as usual, and there was the plane. But
something was wrong. It was afire. You could
see the flames plainly. It flew in a crazy
fashion——”</p>

<p>“That must have been while Warren Long
was fighting the flames,” interrupted Jimmy.</p>

<p>“And it went sailing by pretty fast. For a
time the fire seemed to die down, and I thought
the pilot had it about out. Then it burst out
worse than ever. By this time the plane was a
long way past here. But it turned and headed
back. I knew right away that the pilot was trying
to reach the field where you just landed. I
called to Dad that a plane was on fire and was
heading for the landing field, and that maybe
we could help save the ship if we got to the field
in time. So we set out together for the field.”</p>

<p>“Do you live far from it?” inquired Jimmy.</p>

<p>“About half a mile, I suppose, though our
land runs clear down to the landing field. Anyway,
before we were half-way to the field we saw
that the pilot would never make it. The whole airplane
seemed to be aflame. It was fairly spouting
fire from all sides. I knew the pilot would
have to jump, and I couldn’t understand why he
stayed with the ship half as long as he did.”</p>

<p>“You would if you knew Warren Long,” interrupted
Jimmy. “That was just like him. He
risked his life to try to save the mail.”</p>

<p>“He risked it, all right,” said Johnnie. “His
plane was just a mass of flames. I don’t see why
he wasn’t burned to death right in the cockpit. I
just stood still and held my breath while I waited
for him to jump.”</p>

<p>“Did you see him when he did jump?”</p>

<p>“See him? Why, you could see everything.
The whole sky was as light as day. Out he came
in a tremendous dive right through a sheet of
flame. I never breathed while I waited for him
to open his parachute. Do you know what happened?
It was awful.”</p>

<p>“What was awful?” demanded Jimmy.</p>

<p>“Why, that burning ship turned over on its
side the instant the pilot left it and dived straight
after him. I thought sure the plane was going
to crash into him. It was frightful to watch. My
heart simply stopped beating while that plane
roared after him. And the pilot was as cool as
an icicle. He just kept on falling and falling
and never moved a muscle. As the plane shot by
him I thought it had struck him, and I cried right
out. But somehow the plane missed him and
shot down like a flaming meteor. Gee! You
should have seen what happened then. Your
friend had his parachute open the instant the
blazing ship had passed him.”</p>

<p>“How high was he?”</p>

<p>“Not very high. Just a few hundred feet.
But the wind caught his parachute instantly and
snapped it open with a jerk. I could see the pilot
spin around like a weather-vane in a wind squall.
You know he was falling head foremost all this
time, and the parachute jerked him upright
quicker than you could wink your eye. It must
have given him an awful jolt.”</p>

<p>“What happened then?” demanded Jimmy.</p>

<p>“Why, Dad and I separated. He ran toward
the plane, to try to save the mail, but I never gave
a thought to the mail. I ran to help the pilot.
I couldn’t help thinking that after all it might be
you, Jimmy. You know a fellow can never be
sure just who’s in a plane.”</p>

<p>“That was mighty kind of you, Johnnie. But
I wasn’t in the plane, and that lets me out of the
story. What did you do when you reached the
pilot?”</p>

<p>“I got to him soon after he hit the ground.
He was all tangled up in his parachute, for he
had come down in some scrub growth and the
cords were twisted among the stems, and the
parachute itself was fast in some bushes. He had
landed pretty hard, too, and was half stunned.
And he wrenched one of his ankles badly. Maybe
it’s sprained. Anyway, I helped him to get out
of his harness, and I told him just to sit down
and take it easy while I gathered up the parachute.
But he didn’t want to wait an instant.
He said he had to get to the ship to try to save
the mail. So he just snatched out his knife and
cut a big piece out of the parachute, and then we
hurried over to the burning ship as fast as he
could walk. He never said a word, but I know
his ankle must have hurt him terribly.”</p>

<p>“Did you save any of the mail?”</p>

<p>“No. When we got there the fire was so hot
you couldn’t get anywhere near the ship. Dad
and some other men had tried to pull some mail-sacks
out of the plane, but it just wasn’t possible.
The fire was too hot. I wasn’t much interested
in the mail or even in the plane. I couldn’t think
of anything but the pilot. He looked awful.
When we got near the burning ship, where it was
light enough to see him well, I noticed at once
that his eyebrows and lashes were burned off, his
face was badly scorched and his hands were
burned almost raw. It’s a wonder he wasn’t
burned to a crisp.”</p>

<p>“His flying suit and his helmet and goggles
saved him,” said Jimmy. “What I can’t understand
is why he didn’t jump sooner. He must
have known well enough that the ship was
doomed.”</p>

<p>“He did. I asked him why he stayed in it so
long, and he told me that he couldn’t leave the
ship any sooner because it might have fallen on
some of the homes beneath him. You see he was
right over the town. So he just kept right on
flying, with the flames all about him, until he
was sure he was clear of the town. What do you
think of that?”</p>

<p>“I am not surprised. In fact, I should be
surprised if he had done anything else. It’s exactly
the sort of thing Warren Long would do.”</p>

<p>“It was the bravest thing I ever heard of,”
said Johnnie.</p>

<p>“Could you do anything for him?” demanded
Jimmy. “His burns must have been very painful.”</p>

<p>“Sure we did. I took him home with me and
mother put some grease on his face and bandaged
his hands. But he didn’t seem to think about
anything except the mail. That evidently worried
him. The pilot soon caught a train going
east, and that is the last I saw of him.”</p>

<p>“Well, you certainly have given me a vivid
account of the affair, Johnnie. You’d make a
good reporter.”</p>

<p>“Gee! I’d like to be one. It’s pretty dull
out here in these mountains. Dad’s got his health
back now and doesn’t really need me any longer.
I’ve been looking for a job in town. If you know
of any opening I wish you’d tell me about it,
Jimmy.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do all I can to help you, Johnnie, though
I don’t believe I can do much for you. You see,
you have never had any experience as a reporter.”</p>

<p>By this time they had reached the burned airship.
Several persons were gathered about it,
for ever since daybreak people had been coming
from far and near to take a look at it. Jimmy
stood for some time viewing the sad wreck.</p>

<p>“Thank God Warren escaped,” he muttered.</p>

<p>Then he slowly walked around the burned
plane, trying to find the best point of view from
which to get a picture. He took several snaps,
from different angles, and then asked Johnnie
to guide him to a spot where he could get the best
picture of the region. Johnnie took him to a
little knoll that rose sharply at no great distance,
and from this vantage-point Jimmy secured an
excellent picture of the countryside, with the
wrecked plane in the very centre of the picture.
Then he and Johnnie walked across the country
to the spot where Warren Long had landed. The
parachute was no longer there, as the remains of
it had been gathered up by the crew sent from the
Air Mail field to salvage what could be saved
from the wreck. But Jimmy was able to see exactly
where Warren Long had struck the ground,
and to get some good snaps of the place.</p>

<p>“I ought to see your father,” said Jimmy,
“and find out exactly what occurred in the effort
to save the mail. Besides, I want to see him anyway.
I haven’t seen him since—I don’t know
when. And I want to see your mother, too.”</p>

<p>“We’ll go over to the house,” replied Johnnie.</p>

<p>“Mother will be there, and Dad is at work somewhere
about the place.”</p>

<p>They hurried over to the farmhouse, and found
both of Johnnie’s parents right at hand. It was
a pleasant meeting, for Jimmy had known the
Lees all his life. He had little time for visiting,
however. Most of the little visit he spent in
asking Mr. Lee questions about the burning
plane and the effort to save the mail. When he
had all the details he could gather, he said goodbye
to Johnnie’s parents. Then the two lads
walked back to the landing field.</p>

<p>Jimmy started his engine and let it run a few
minutes to get warm. When he was ready to depart,
he held out his hand to Johnnie. “I am
ever so glad I found you,” he said, “and I am
more than grateful to you for what you folks
did for Warren Long last night. You have
helped me a lot, Johnnie. I won’t forget about
you when I get back to New York. If there is
anything I can do for you, I will certainly do it.
Now I must be off. They want these pictures
at the office just as soon as they can get them.
Good-bye.” And Jimmy was off.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:1.0em;'>Jimmy Makes Good</p>

<p>His mind white-hot with the fire of interest,
his very soul atremble with eagerness to
get the gripping story on paper, Jimmy drove
his plane through the air like an eagle cleaving
the sky. A stiff west wind that had sprung up
hurled him onward. And Jimmy climbed high
to get every ounce of help possible, for at the
higher altitudes the wind was almost a gale. So
he reached his hangar in an amazingly short time.
He ran his ship under cover and saw that the
gasoline supply was replenished immediately, to
prevent the condensation of moisture in the fuel
tanks as the ship cooled. Eager though he was
to write, Jimmy was taking no chances of getting
water in his gasoline. His oil supply was also
replenished. These things attended to, Jimmy
turned immediately to the business of getting his
story ready for print.</p>

<p>A taxi took him speedily to the <span class='it'>Morning Press</span>
office in Manhattan. There he told his city editor
what he had learned. And he told it so eagerly
and so convincingly that that usually bored individual
sat up and listened with interest.</p>

<p>“If you can put that on paper as well as you
tell it,” said the city editor, “you may write
three-quarters of a column. We’ll run two or
three pictures with it, if they are any good, and
play the story up for all it’s worth.”</p>

<p>“What did you learn from Hadley?” asked
Jimmy. “Have you heard from the man you
sent down there?”</p>

<p>“He couldn’t get a thing at first-hand. Your
friend the pilot is in bed, under the doctor’s orders,
and could not see our reporter. All the
latter could get was what he picked up from men
about the airport. There wasn’t anything you
don’t have and nothing half so good. So there
will be no facts for you from that source. Write
what you have, as plainly and simply as you told
it to me just now. I’ll send you prints of your
photographs as soon as they are done. We ought
to have proofs very shortly.”</p>

<p>Jimmy had not expected to write the entire
story. Indeed, he had not been certain that he
would have a chance to write any of it. The
man who had been sent to see Warren Long was
an experienced and able reporter, and Jimmy
rather expected that this reporter would do the
writing, and that all Jimmy could do would be
to tell his story to his fellow reporter. But the
matter had turned out just the opposite. Jimmy
himself was to write the story.</p>

<p>He realized that once more a big chance had
come to him. For weeks—ever since he had won
his new job, in fact—he had been doing little
assignments, hoping every day that something
worthwhile would come his way; and now this
thing had happened. He meant to make the most
of it.</p>

<p>Altogether without realizing it, Jimmy had prepared
himself to do a good piece of work. He
did not understand that the surest way to write
a really great story is to be so full of a subject
and to feel the story so intensely that one is just
bursting with it. Yet that was exactly the situation
Jimmy was in. His love for Warren Long,
his admiration for that heroic pilot, and his desire
to tell all the world what a truly remarkable
thing his friend had done—all this, coupled with
Jimmy’s keen sense of the dramatic, had prepared
him to write a gripping story. It was the
same thing that had happened when he wrote the
story of the Air Mail bandit. Jimmy was so full
of the subject that he could think of nothing
else.</p>

<p>Now he sat down at a typewriter in a corner,
where he was not likely to be disturbed, and got
ready to write. He had been turning the story
over and over in his mind. He wanted to begin
it in a way that would catch and hold the imagination
of the reader. The feature of the story
that appealed to his own imagination most powerfully
was the picture of Warren Long sitting
in his flaming cockpit and being slowly roasted
while he guided his plane away from the little
hamlet and out to the uninhabited districts, where
it could not possibly fall on a house and burn up
some humble home. To Jimmy’s mind that
picture was even more compelling than the one of
Warren Long’s falling headfirst to earth and
calmly waiting for his blazing ship to pass him
before he opened his parachute. In almost any
other case, this latter picture would have been
an unparalleled feature. But to Jimmy, while it
was extremely spectacular, it lacked the appeal
of the other picture. And Jimmy was right.
His news sense in this case was unerring. For
Warren Long, risking death in his cockpit in order
to save others, was a far more appealing figure
than Warren Long doing something spectacularly
cool and brave to save his own life.</p>

<p>Jimmy rightly judged that what appealed to
him most powerfully would also probably appeal
most powerfully to others. So he began his story
with this feature of greatest appeal—the picture
of Warren Long’s sacrificing himself to save
some humble country folk that he didn’t even
know. When he had written what he had to say
about this, Jimmy took up the story of the pilot’s
drop to earth, and the breathtaking experience he
had had as his flaming plane dived after him.
Finally he told the story, simply but graphically,
of how Johnnie Lee had rushed over the rough
mountain in the dark to aid the fallen pilot, and
how he had taken care of him from the moment
he came upon him, entangled in his parachute in
the scrub growth, up to the moment that the pilot
stepped on the east-bound train.</p>

<p>So full of the story was Jimmy that he heard
nothing, saw nothing, thought of nothing but the
tale he was putting on paper. Before him he
could see the scene he was picturing—see it as
vividly as though he were still on the spot. And
unconsciously he found himself using almost
word for word the vivid description of the accident
that Johnnie Lee had given him. His mind
was so full of the story that, once he had begun
to write, the tale came pouring from his typewriter
as tumultuously and sparklingly as a mountain
torrent rushes down its rocky bed. When at
last he ended his story, he had done a truly fine
piece of work. His tale was so fresh and vivid
that it could not fail to attract attention. Jimmy,
of course, did not realize that. All he knew was
that he had done the very best he could. If there
was any luck about the story, it was in the matter
of the photographs. They were as clear and sharp
as Jimmy’s word pictures. And they illuminated
the text excellently.</p>

<p>When Jimmy had read the story over and
made such corrections as appeared to him desirable,
he took it to the city editor. Then, thinking
the latter might wish to question him about some
of the facts, he sat down and waited until his
editor could read the story. Jimmy was right
in his guess that Mr. Davis might want to ask
about the story. But he was much surprised at
the question Mr. Davis put to him.</p>

<p>The latter read the story and then glanced
through it a second time. Then he looked at
Jimmy. “Where did you get the idea of writing
this story as you have written it?” he demanded.</p>

<p>Jimmy felt his heart sink. He was sure he had
made a failure. But he answered cheerfully
enough: “I wrote it that way, Mr. Davis, because
I couldn’t write it any other way. All I could
see when I tried to write was Warren Long sitting
in his burning cockpit and roasting while he
piloted his ship to a point where it wouldn’t do
any damage when it came down.”</p>

<p>“Just keep on seeing things that way,” said
the city editor. And without another word he
picked up the story and the photographs and
walked away.</p>

<p>Jimmy left the office somewhat puzzled and
almost disconsolate. He felt sure his effort had
been a failure. The city editor had not said one
good word about it. And yet what did he mean
by telling Jimmy to “keep on seeing things that
way”? Jimmy was sorely puzzled. But if he
could have seen where the city editor went and
what he did with the story, Jimmy would have
been amazed. For Mr. Davis went straight to
the managing editor and laid the manuscript and
the pictures on the latter’s desk. All he said was
this: “Here is a story young Donnelly just
wrote. He flew over to Ringtown to get a follow-up
on this morning’s A. P. despatch about
the parachute jump of a mail pilot there last
night. I wish you’d read it.”</p>

<p>But Jimmy had no way of knowing this, and
even if he had had he would hardly have understood
the significance of the thing. He could
hardly have known what it meant for the city
editor thus to call the attention of the managing
editor to a story before it got into type. But
Jimmy would have been well enough pleased if
he could have heard Mr. Johnson mutter to himself,
after carefully reading the story, “Well, I
guess we made no mistake in making a reporter
out of Donnelly. I’ll tell the city editor to try
him out on something bigger than the assignments
he has been getting.”</p>

<p>So was illustrated the law that “To him that
hath shall be given.” Jimmy had demonstrated
his ability. And as is always the case, a display
of ability was soon followed by greater opportunity.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:1.0em;'>The Long Flight to a Fire</p>

<p>Jimmy’s next chance was not long in coming.
A few days after he made his successful trip
to Ringtown, Jimmy was called to the telephone
in his hangar. Mr. Johnson was speaking.</p>

<p>“We have just had a ‘flash’ from Cleveland,”
he said, “to the effect that there has been
a terrible disaster in a hospital there. The burning
of X-ray films filled the hospital with deadly
gases, and apparently scores of people have been
killed. We are getting the A. P. service, but the
story is so big we should like to have our own man
on the spot. I am sending Frank Handley over
to you. Be prepared to take off the moment he
arrives. You are to cooperate with him in handling
the story. Handley knows exactly what I
want and will give you directions. We especially
want good pictures. In all probability the wires
will be clogged with the volume of news matter
filed. I am sending you to make sure that we
get our story and the pictures. Get them back
any way you can—by wire or by plane. But get
them back. That is the important thing. Handley
is already on his way and should reach you
very soon.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be ready for him, Mr. Johnson,” said
Jimmy, “and I’ll do my level best to carry out
your orders. What is my deadline?”</p>

<p>“We want to be sure to catch the state edition.
The presses start at midnight sharp. You ought
to be here by eleven, and you <span class='it'>must</span> be here by
eleven-thirty at the latest.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be there,” said Jimmy, but little could
he foresee what it was going to cost him to make
good that promise.</p>

<p>He hung up the telephone receiver and skipped
out into the hangar to start his engine to warming.
Then he gathered up his camera, his portable
typewriter, and all the other equipment he
ordinarily carried in his plane. The cabin of his
ship was especially fitted up with a desk, where
he or any one else could write. In this desk he
stowed his typewriter and camera, so they would
not be thrown about in the plane in case of rough
going. In the floor of the ship there was a special
opening for the taking of photographs vertically.
The sides of the ship were lined with windows,
to permit easy observation in all directions.</p>

<p>“We probably shall not have a minute to get
anything to eat,” thought Jimmy. “I’ll put a
lunch aboard and we can eat it as we fly.”</p>

<p>He ran out to a near-by lunch wagon and had
some sandwiches and milk prepared for him. By
the time he got back with these, a taxi was just
rolling up with Handley. Jimmy greeted his
fellow reporter, whom he liked very much, and
grabbed up the latter’s little typewriter. Handley
followed with a suitcase. They stowed the
luggage in the plane, which was now ready to
sail. Jimmy helped Handley buckle on a parachute.
Then he strapped on his own. They
stepped into the cabin and in another moment
were climbing aloft as rapidly as Jimmy’s engine
would lift them.</p>

<p>Once more Jimmy flew south of west to connect
with the Air Mail route to Cleveland. A
slight breeze was blowing at a higher altitude, so
Jimmy went hedge-hopping along to avoid the
wind as much as possible. The air seemed
“dead” to him. It felt as though a storm might
be brewing. So he plugged in with his head
phones and listened for the hourly report of the
Airways Weather Bureau. He hadn’t long to
wait. Soon he heard the wireless man at Hadley
Field broadcasting. Jimmy listened intently.
He learned that the weather was fair all the way
to Cleveland. But the sky was overcast and the
ceiling low. Visibility was poor. There was little
wind. The prospect was for increasing cloudiness
and bad weather.</p>

<p>“We ought to make Cleveland all right,”
thought Jimmy. “It isn’t quite 400 miles from
Hadley to Cleveland. There isn’t any wind to
speak of, so I won’t have to stop at Bellefonte
for gas. I ought to make the trip from Hadley
in close to three hours.”</p>

<p>Jimmy looked down and saw that he was already
almost abreast of that airport. “In three
hours,” he muttered, “I’m <span class='it'>going</span> to be in Cleveland.
This ship can do it, and I’ll make her do
it.” He opened his throttle a little wider, and
the plane darted ahead faster than ever.</p>

<p>Away they soared, over the flat lands of New
Jersey, above the hills of Pennsylvania, almost
straight westward. As they drew near Ringtown
Jimmy studied the country closely. He wondered
if Johnnie were down there watching him.</p>

<p>“If he has a good pair of field-glasses,”
thought Jimmy, “he will easily be able to identify
the plane. We are flying so low that he can
see my license number plainly. And he ought
to be able to read the name New York <span class='it'>Morning
Press</span> painted on the sides of the ship. I guess
I’ll drop him a greeting.”</p>

<p>Hastily he drew a little pad of paper from his
pocket, and while he guided the ship with his left
hand scribbled this message with his right on the
pad, which he placed on his right leg.</p>

<p>“Hello, Johnnie. Going to Cleveland. Be
back here about 9:30 to-night. Signal me as I
go over. If you have a radio sending set, get in
touch with me then. Jimmy Donnelly.”</p>

<p>Snatching from his pocket his handkerchief
and a piece of string, Jimmy passed them over to
Handley. “Tie strings to each corner of the
handkerchief,” he shouted into his ear, “and make
a little parachute. I want to drop a message.”</p>

<p>Handley had the parachute made in no time.
Jimmy handed him the message for Johnnie.
“Tie it fast and put a weight on it,” he shouted.
“Look in the desk.”</p>

<p>Handley found some linotype slugs. He tied
two or three to the little parachute. Jimmy motioned
for him to toss the thing overboard.
Handley slid a window open and dropped the
message for Johnnie. They were almost directly
over the little village. They could see a number
of people on the ground watching them; for
Jimmy was still flying as low as he dared to fly.
The improvised parachute fluttered down, and
several figures darted toward it. But long before
Jimmy’s message reached the earth, Jimmy himself
was far beyond the town. It was impossible
to see what had happened to his message, but
Jimmie had no doubt it would get to Johnnie
Lee promptly.</p>

<p>On they roared. Jimmy’s ship was built for
speed. He seldom drove it at its fastest, for that
was hard on the engine. But to-day he pushed
it along much faster than his ordinary cruising
speed. He fully intended to reach Cleveland
within the specified time.</p>

<p>As they winged their way westward, Jimmy
studied the sky intently. No ray of sunlight anywhere
penetrated the dark cloud masses. The
sky had a sullen, angry aspect. Though the air
was quiet, Jimmy felt that perhaps this was the
calm before the storm. He was quite sure that
the good weather could not last until he was
safely back on Long Island. So he listened
closely to the weather broadcasts and tried to
read the signs in the sky.</p>

<p>Jimmy made the Cleveland Airport by three
o’clock. Before his ship glided to earth, he and
Handley had consumed their little luncheon, and
thus fortified were ready to plunge into the difficult
task that lay ahead of them. They waited
only long enough to order their plane serviced
promptly, then they stepped into a taxi and were
whirled toward the city.</p>

<p>At Handley’s suggestion they drove directly
to the office of the Police Commissioner, where
Handley presented his credentials and asked that
he and Jimmy be given police passes. This took
a little time, but Handley was too experienced a
reporter to take any chances of delay later on.
Their request was promptly granted. Thanking
the Cleveland officials, the two New Yorkers hurried
back to their taxi and were whirled off to
the scene of the disaster. So great was the jam
of trucks and fire apparatus and other vehicles
that their taxi could not approach within several
blocks of the hospital. Handley paid the driver.</p>

<p>“We shall need you all the afternoon,” he said.
“Stay right here and wait for us. We shall
probably have to drive about considerably.”</p>

<p>The driver agreed to wait for them, and Jimmy
and his companion raced toward the hospital.
Handley had his typewriter and Jimmy his camera.
Newsies were crying the latest extras of
the local papers. The New Yorkers bought
copies of every paper offered for sale and hastily
scanned them, marking names and addresses.
Then they pushed on.</p>

<p>Though it was now more than four hours since
the explosion occurred, there was still great
excitement and activity about the hospital.
Policemen and firemen were still stationed about
the place. The dead and injured had been removed
and the fire extinguished. But the building
still smoked, and the air was heavy with that
peculiarly offensive odor that comes from a
burned building, combined with the noxious
fumes from the burned X-ray films and chemicals
that still persisted in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Coming to the scene so late, Jimmy and his
comrade were at a great disadvantage. The dead
and injured had been removed, the former to the
county morgue, the latter to various hospitals
within the city. Those people who had been
present when the fire started were mostly gone.
Policemen, firemen, doctors, and officials, nervously
unstrung by the day’s tragedies and taxed
by conflict with the surging crowds and by repeated
interviews with newspaper men, were
blunt, brusque, and often rude. Crowds thronged
about the place and it was difficult to move.</p>

<p>“We want to get hold of some of the people
who saw the thing from the start and get statements
from them,” said Handley. “Then we
want to interview just as many doctors, nurses,
patients, firemen, policemen, and others who were
witnesses of the tragedy as we can get in touch
with. We ought to have pictures of the interior
of the wrecked building and the outside. And
we should have some showing the work of rescue
in progress. Maybe we can buy these latter pictures.
You try for some photographs and I’ll
get interviews. When you get your pictures,
hunt me up. I’ll be somewhere about the place.”</p>

<p>Jimmy thrust his police pass into his hatband
and hurried toward the wrecked building. A
policeman was guarding the entrance. Jimmy
did not know whether the policeman would permit
him to enter or not. A thought came to him.
He stepped up to the bluecoat. “I’m told that
you rescued more people than almost any other
man on the force. I want your picture for tomorrow’s
paper. Just step inside the reception
room where I can get you without this crowd and
let me snap a picture, won’t you please?” And
Jimmy darted right on into the hospital.</p>

<p>The policeman, with a self-conscious look on
his face followed. Jimmy didn’t give him time
to say a word. “Stand right over there, where
the light’s good,” he said. And when the policeman
hesitated, Jimmy took him by the arm and
shoved him against the wall. Then he backed off
and snapped a picture of him.</p>

<p>“That’s fine,” said Jimmy, talking as fast as
he could to prevent the policeman from saying
anything, “but it doesn’t show what it should.
This reception room is hardly damaged at all.
I want you with a background that will show the
danger you had to face. Some of the rooms upstairs
are pretty well torn to pieces, aren’t they?
I want a picture of you with that background.
Come on.” And Jimmy scurried up a stairway.</p>

<p>The policeman followed. By this time he had
found his tongue. He seemed pleased with
Jimmy’s interest. “The worst looking room is
over here,” he said, and he led the way through
a corridor filled with debris. The plaster had
been blown from the ceiling, the walls were torn
and broken, the window-glass was blown out,
furniture was smashed and splintered, and the
entire room was in a state of the utmost confusion.</p>

<p>“Stand right there,” said Jimmy, posing his
victim before a shattered and bulging section of
wall. Then he snapped his picture before the
policeman could protest.</p>

<p>“I believe I can get some better pictures up
here than any I have,” said Jimmy, and he took
several pictures that perfectly portrayed the
havoc wrought by the explosion.</p>

<p>“I must get back to my post,” said the policeman,
suddenly remembering that he was supposed
to be guarding the front door.</p>

<p>Jimmy’s heart fell. He thought he was about
to be ordered out of the building. But he was
equal to the occasion.</p>

<p>“You won’t be leaving the place for a while,
will you?” he asked. “I want to talk to you.
I’ll look you up at the front door just as soon as
I get another picture or two.”</p>

<p>The policeman hesitated. He glanced at
Jimmy’s police pass, and though he had been
ordered to keep everybody out of the building
except policemen, firemen, and hospital employees,
he allowed Jimmy to remain, while he himself
returned to guard the front door. Doubtless he
thought that the damage was already done, and
that it would do no harm if Jimmy did get another
picture or two. As for Jimmy, the moment the
policeman’s back was turned he scurried higher
up in the wrecked building and took picture after
picture.</p>

<p>His remark about the policeman’s bravery had
been a shot in the dark. Jimmy hadn’t any idea
whether the man had been present during the disaster
or not. But he knew the weakness most
folks have for wishing to appear like heroes, and
he knew that policemen are no exception to the
rule. As luck would have it, this policeman had
actually had a share in the work of rescue.
Jimmy found that out when he hurried back to
the front door after getting all the pictures he
wanted.</p>

<p>“Please spell your name for me,” he said, as
the policeman turned to greet him. “I want to
be sure I get it right.”</p>

<p>“L-a-f-f-e-r-t-y—Dennis Lafferty,” the policeman
spelled out, a letter at a time.</p>

<p>“That’s fine,” said Jimmy. “I just hate to
get a man’s name wrong. And I’d hate mighty
bad to get yours wrong after all the fine work
you did.”</p>

<p>Jimmy could see the man swelling with pride.</p>

<p>“I only did my duty,” he said.</p>

<p>“Tell me about it,” urged Jimmy. “Maybe
the fellow who told me about it didn’t have the
story straight.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Lafferty, “I was on duty directing
traffic two blocks down the street when the
explosion occurred. I heard it and ran up here.
A woman was struggling to get out of the door
right where we are, and I rushed up to help her.
Just then I got a whiff of the gas. I knew right
away what it was, for you see I was in the World
War. So I jammed my handkerchief over my
nose, grabbed the woman by the arm, and helped
her out of the building. When I turned to go
back I saw clouds of yellow gas swirling out
through the door. I knew it was worse than useless
to go back into the building, so I ran around
to the side of the structure to see if there was
some other way to get people out.</p>

<p>“By that time the firemen had begun to arrive,
and they were driven back by the gas just as I
had been. Battalion Chief Michael Graham was
the first chief on the grounds. When he saw it
was useless to try to enter the first floor, he ordered
a motor extension ladder run up to the
roof. Then he and some of his men went up it.
I scrambled after them. Two firemen hacked
away a skylight and three or four of us was lowered
into the building by ropes.”</p>

<p>Just then Handley went hurrying past the
front door.</p>

<p>“Frank,” shouted Jimmy. “Come here a
moment.”</p>

<p>Handley turned, saw Jimmy, and came up the
steps to him.</p>

<p>“How are you making out?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Fine,” said Jimmy. “I want you to meet
Policeman Dennis Lafferty. He was one of the
first policemen to arrive after the explosion. Mr.
Lafferty, this is Mr. Handley, my fellow reporter.”</p>

<p>Handley held out his hand to the policeman.</p>

<p>“Mr. Lafferty was just telling me about the
way he and some firemen got into the building by
way of the roof. They saved a lot of people that
way. I’ve got some good snaps of Mr. Lafferty
and I want to be sure to get his story correct.”
Then he turned to the policeman. “Won’t you
tell the story to Mr. Handley?” he asked. “I’ve
got to get some more pictures. Handley and I
are working together on this story.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said the policeman. “It’s all one to
me.”</p>

<p>He began to talk to Handley and Jimmy hurried
away to get some exterior views. He was
able to climb up on a building across the street
and get a picture of the crowd that jammed the
street and the open lawn by the side of the clinic
building. Extension ladders were still raised to
the roof and to different windows, and by good
luck a number of firemen were coming down two
of them. From other points of vantage Jimmy
snapped the building and the crowd several times.
When he had taken all the photographs he
wanted, he hurried back to the front of the building.
Handley had just met one of the hospital
doctors, who had returned to the building to try
to secure some important papers. The physician
courteously stopped to answer Handley’s
questions. Jimmy seized the opportunity to talk to
Policeman Lafferty again.</p>

<p>“Did you see any other people who helped in
the rescue?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Sure. I saw lots of them. There were
dozens of folks who had a hand in it.”</p>

<p>“Tell me about some of them, won’t you
please? What was the most striking thing you
saw?”</p>

<p>“I hardly know,” said Lafferty. “But there
was a big colored fellow who saved a lot of people.
You ought to know about him.”</p>

<p>“What did he do and what is his name?”
asked Jimmy.</p>

<p>“His name is Chapin—Bob Chapin. He’s a
tremendous big fellow. He works in a garage
near here. When he heard the explosion and
found the hospital was afire, he grabbed up a
ladder and ran up here quick. He put the ladder
up to a window where a lot of people was trying
to get out. The ladder was too short. So Chapin
picked it up, rested it on his shoulders, and shoved
the end up to the window. It just reached. Ten
people come down the ladder while he held it on
his shoulders. Then he ran inside and carried out
about as many more. He saved almost two
dozen people.”</p>

<p>Just then Handley came hurrying back.
“We’ve got to move along, Jimmy,” he said.
“We’ve played in luck here. I’ve got more stuff
than I ever dreamed I could get. Now we must
hustle over to the hospitals and the morgue and
get names and see how the injured are doing.”</p>

<p>They said good-bye to Policeman Lafferty and
thanked him for his help. Then they raced down
the street toward the place where their taxi driver
awaited. The man was there. They climbed into
the car and were whirled off at speed to the
Mt. Sinai Hospital, where most of the victims
had been taken.</p>

<p>By this time the hospital authorities had secured
some sort of order. Lists of names were
posted, which helped the reporters greatly. As
the emergency patients were placed everywhere,
in corridors and hallways as well as in the wards,
Jimmy and his comrade managed to reach several
of them and get from them first-hand accounts
of what happened in the hospital immediately
after the first explosion occurred. Also they
were able to talk briefly with one or two nurses.</p>

<p>From the Mt. Sinai Hospital they drove to
the other hospitals and finally to the morgue.
They secured all the names available of both the
dead and injured.</p>

<p>“We’ve had wonderful luck,” said Handley.
“I’ve got enough stuff to write columns, and I
don’t know how much more you have.”</p>

<p>“Let me tell you what I picked up,” said
Jimmy. “Some of it may be better than some
of the stuff you have. Anyway it will be different.”</p>

<p>They hurried out to their taxi and got into it.
“Here are my notes,” said Jimmy. “Now let
me tell you briefly what they mean.”</p>

<p>Hastily he ran over the incidents he had gathered.
Handley followed the notes as he listened.
When Jimmy finished, Handley looked at his
watch. “Give me that typewriter quick,” he
said. In another moment the keys were flying
under his fingers.</p>

<p>“Wait,” said Jimmy. “While you write I
could be getting rescue pictures.” Without a
word, Handley grabbed his things and stepped
from the cab. “I’ll write right here on the
hospital steps,” he said. “Hurry back.”</p>

<p>Jimmy directed the taxi driver to take him to the
nearest big newspaper. They drove off at speed.
Jimmy found the city editor, told him who he was,
and asked if he could buy a few rescue pictures for
use in the <span class='it'>Morning Press</span> in New York. He
showed his <span class='it'>Press</span> credentials. The city editor
turned him over to the photograph staff and
Jimmy got several good prints that showed firemen
carrying unconscious victims down ladders
at the wrecked hospital. He thanked the newspaper
men for their help, ran out to his taxi, and
was rushed back to his comrade. Handley was
still pounding away on his typewriter, utterly oblivious
to all that went on about him. He hardly
even looked up when Jimmy sat down beside him
and started to read the story Handley had written.
Jimmy marveled as he watched his colleague
dash off the tale. He wondered if he would ever
be able to write like that. He was amazed at the
gripping quality of the story Handley had written.
At last the latter tore the final sheet from
his typewriter. He had made carbon copies as he
wrote. Jimmy had already sorted out the two sets
of sheets. He stuffed one copy of the story into
his own pocket and handed the other copy to
Handley.</p>

<p>“We’ve certainly played in luck,” he said.
“Let us hope I have as good luck getting back
to the office.”</p>

<p>Jimmy glanced up at the sky. So intent had
he been upon his work that he had forgotten
about the weather. What he saw now brought
a deep frown to his face. “We’ll have to be
stepping,” he said. “It’s already six-thirty. I
should have been off before this.”</p>

<p>“I’ll stay here and get more stuff,” said Handley.
“Good luck to you.” He turned to the
driver of the taxi. “To the airport as fast as you
can make it,” he said. “This man has to be in
New York by eleven o’clock.”</p>

<p>They dashed off at speed. At the airport
Jimmy hurried to the office of the weather forecaster.
There he found Mr. Beverly Graham,
who was in charge of the entire eastern section of
the Airways Weather Bureau, and who had been
the forecaster at Hadley Field in the days when
Jimmy was in the U. S. mail service.</p>

<p>“Well, where in the world did you come from,
Jimmy?” asked Mr. Graham, as he jumped to
his feet and held out his hand. “I’m glad to see
you.”</p>

<p>“Not half as much as I am to see you,” replied
Jimmy, shaking Mr. Graham’s hand heartily.
“You know I’m flying for the New York <span class='it'>Press</span>,
and I’ve got the story of the hospital disaster in
my pocket and a camera full of pictures. I’ve
got to reach New York as quick as I can get
there. What’s the weather like along the line?”</p>

<p>Mr. Graham frowned and looked at Jimmy
intently. “I’m sorry you have to fly to-night,”
he said. “The weather couldn’t be worse.
There’s the densest kind of a fog from one end
of Pennsylvania to the other.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, too,” said Jimmy, looking glum.
“But it has to be done. The <span class='it'>Press</span> simply
<span class='it'>must</span> get these pictures.”</p>

<p>“I know how you feel about it, Jimmy. If
you must go, perhaps you can get up above the
fog. Be sure to ride high and follow your radio
beacon exactly. That’ll guide you all right if
you don’t have a forced landing. Your greatest
difficulty will probably be to get down safely.
The fog isn’t so bad along the coast yet, but we
can’t tell what conditions will be like when you
reach there. The wind is pretty quiet. There’s
a twenty-mile wind at 5,000 feet. I can’t tell you
what it is like above that. We couldn’t see our
balloons beyond that height, and even this information
is two hours old. Fog and clouds have
shut out every thing up high the past hour.
Here’s a weather chart for you with the latest
news we have been able to collect. Fog is solid
through Pennsylvania.”</p>

<p>Jimmy studied the chart for a moment. His
face grew very serious. Then he said, “Thanks
ever so much. I must be off. Good-bye.” He
held out his hand and the forecaster shook it
warmly.</p>

<p>“I don’t like it, Jimmy,” he said. “I hope
you get through safely. Remember to fly high
and follow your radio beacon carefully. Don’t
take any chance of getting lost in the fog. We’ll
do all we can to help you make it.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>CHAPTER VI</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:1.0em;'>Flying Blind Over the Graveyard of Airplanes</p>

<p>Jimmy looked very sober as he climbed into
his plane. He was about to tackle the meanest
job a pilot is called upon to attempt. Had
he been at the other end of the line, starting westward,
with the wind in his face, instead of starting
eastward, with the breeze at his back, he would
hardly have dared to attempt it. But inasmuch
as he did not have to make a landing in Pennsylvania,
he was willing to try it, although the
weather man had suggested that by the time he
reached Long Island it might be foggy there also.
Jimmy decided to take the chance.</p>

<p>But he wasn’t going to take any more chances
than he absolutely had to take. So he switched
on his navigation lights, tested his landing lights,
made sure his flares were hooked, ready for release,
and glanced at his instruments. Then he
speeded up his engine and listened to its roar.
The instant he was satisfied that everything was
working perfectly, he took off.</p>

<p>He hopped into the wind, then circled back
to the east, and was away like an arrow. Although
the atmosphere at Cleveland was only
beginning to grow foggy, before Jimmy had risen
a hundred feet in the air the bright lights of the
airport began to be blurred. As Jimmy passed
directly over the great hangar, after circling, he
could barely tell where it was. In another minute
low clouds had wiped out every trace of the
earth. No matter where he looked, nothing was
visible but thick, clinging banks of fog.</p>

<p>Jimmy had been in fog before, but he had
never made a trip such as this one promised to
be. Always the fogs he had ridden through had
dissipated after a time, but this fog-bank bade
fair to cover every inch of the four hundred and
fifty miles or so to his home field. The possibilities
of getting lost, of crashing, of meeting
with dire disaster in a flight of such length, were
too many for Jimmy to allow himself to consider
them.</p>

<p>He did not permit himself even to think of
these possibilities. Instead, he called up every
bit of flying ability he possessed to meet the
situation. At two or three hundred feet elevation
he had gone blind. From that point onward,
he had to fly wholly by his instruments.</p>

<p>Setting his course by his compass, he sat listening
to the guiding note of the radio beacon, his
eyes glued to the instrument board. From his
compass his eyes darted to his turn-and-bank
indicator, then to his air speed indicator. Occasionally
he glanced at his engine instruments,
to see that his propeller was making the necessary
revolutions per minute, that the engine temperature
was not too high, that his oil pressure remained
constant.</p>

<p>But mostly he kept watch of his speed and of
his position. The steel ball in the centre of the
turn-and-bank indicator had to be kept right in
the centre. Every time the ball began to slide
one way or the other, Jimmy had to bring his
ship back to a level keel, for the moving steel ball
showed that he was beginning to dip to one side
or the other. Sense of balance told him little or
nothing; and had it not been for his indicator, he
might soon have been flying upside down, as
many a pilot before him had done. Nor could
he allow his ship to drop below a speed of sixty
miles an hour, lest it come crashing to earth.</p>

<p>All the while the radio beacon signal was buzzing
loudly in his ears. “Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah,
dah,” the signal sounded. It came to him with
startling intensity. That was because his ship
was close to the beacon itself. As he traveled
onward, Jimmy knew, the signal would grow
fainter and fainter, for during the first half of
the flight to Bellefonte he would be guided by the
signals from the airport he had just left. Beyond
that he would be guided by the Bellefonte signals,
and he knew these would grow ever louder as he
neared that field.</p>

<p>Up he climbed, and up and up, seeking to get
above the fog. Again and again he glanced at his
altimeter, but though he had risen to five thousand
feet, and then six and seven and eight
thousand, he was still in dense mist. He
continued to climb, to watch his instruments, to listen
to the radio beacon. All the time he was trying
to check his position. He watched his air speed
indicator. He watched his tachometer, which indicated
his revolutions per minute. He watched
his clock. He checked one against the other.
With a twenty-mile wind at his back, Jimmy figured
he must be making fully one hundred and
fifty miles an hour. At that speed he should
make his home field in close to three hours. Then
he should have to make the trip to the New York
office of the <span class='it'>Press</span>. It looked to Jimmy as though
he ought easily to reach the <span class='it'>Press</span> office by eleven
o’clock. The thought heartened him.</p>

<p>He could travel faster, if he had to, but he
did not want to drive his ship as fast on the return
trip as he had driven it in coming west. It
was too hard on the ship. So he watched his instruments
and held his plane to the speed indicated.</p>

<p>All the while he climbed. Up he went steadily.
From eight thousand feet he climbed to nine,
then ten. Still the fog was unbroken. But his
engine worked marvelously in the heavy air and
he kept his ship nosing higher and higher. Suddenly,
at eleven thousand feet, he shot up above
the fog. The night was clear as crystal. Above
him twinkled innumerable stars. With a deep
sigh of relief Jimmy climbed a little higher, then
straightened out and rode on level keel. Below
him spread endless masses of cloud, more wonderful
than an ocean, dimly lighted by the stars
above. So long as he could ride above the fog his
trip was now an easy one. He had only to follow
his compass and the radio beacon. The difficulty
would come when he had to drop down through
the fog and make a landing.</p>

<p>While Jimmy was thus fighting both to insure
his safety and to gain his goal, agencies of which
he was not aware were also at work to try to
make his progress safe. Hardly had Jimmy left
the ground at the Cleveland Airport before
Beverly Graham hurried into the radio room.</p>

<p>“Sparks,” he said to the radio man, “I wish
you would send a message on your printer saying
that Jimmy Donnelly, flying for the New York
<span class='it'>Morning Press</span>, just left here, heading for Long
Island. The message will reach caretakers at
beacons all along the route. Tell all caretakers
to report his progress to me as he goes over their
beacons. Nobody else is flying east at this time
that we know of and it’s very doubtful if anybody
else will go over the route to-night.”</p>

<p>The wireless man turned to his printer and
began to pound out the message on the keyboard.
But the machine on which he was writing, though
it somewhat resembled a typewriter, was not a
typewriter at all, but an electric printing or teletype
machine, which reproduced the message on
similar machines at Bellefonte and Hadley Field
and other stations as fast as it was written. In no
time, therefore, these two Air Mail stations and
the caretakers at various landing fields, knew
that Jimmy was flying east in the fog. Thus as
Jimmy passed over Mercer and Clarion and other
points on the airway in western Pennsylvania his
progress was promptly reported to his friend, the
chief forecaster.</p>

<p>But long before Jimmy reached the “graveyard
of airplanes” he himself was aware that
Beverly Graham was making a special effort in
his behalf. When he was only a short distance
out of Cleveland he heard the hourly weather
broadcast from the Cleveland radio man. Jimmy
listened intently, though there was little they
could tell him about the weather that he did not
already know. The usual, stereotyped broadcast
contained no reference to the wind. That
was the one thing Jimmy wanted to know about.
A moment later he heard the Cleveland radio man
saying: “Mr. Donnelly, in the New York
<span class='it'>Morning Press</span> plane, will please note that the
wind has shifted slightly from west to southwest
and has increased to twenty-five miles an hour.
He will also please listen carefully for a message
when he passes over Bellefonte.”</p>

<p>“Good old Beverly,” said Jimmy. “He never
forgets a friend. He didn’t want me to fly tonight,
but now that I am up in the air he’s
doing all he can for me. I wonder what he has
instructed Bellefonte to do. I’ll thank him at
once.”</p>

<p>When Jimmy’s plane was built it had been
equipped with a radio receiving set. But about
two weeks before he was ordered to Cleveland,
Jimmy had succeeded in having a sending set
installed in the plane, thus bringing his ship right
up to date. Not even all the mail planes had
sending sets as yet, though some of them did.</p>

<p>Jimmy picked up his instrument, put the
mouthpiece to his lips, and sent this message into
the air: “Jimmy Donnelly, of the <span class='it'>Morning
Press</span>, speaking. Cleveland weather forecast received.
Also special notice as to force and direction
of the wind. Will get into touch with Bellefonte
as I go over. Thanks very much for help.
I shall need all I can get.”</p>

<p>He replaced the mouthpiece and settled back
in his seat. A quick glance at his instrument
board assured him that all was working well. He
looked at his clock and tried to figure out his
position. Suddenly he became aware that the
buzzing in his ears had altered. No longer did
he hear the regular “dah, dah, dah, dah, dah,”
which told him he was directly on the air line.
Instead Jimmy heard the signal “dot dah, dot
dah, dot dah, dot dah, dot dah.” He knew he
was to the left of the course.</p>

<p>“That’s the work of the wind,” thought
Jimmy. “Shifting to the southwest, it has
blown me to the northeast of the line. I’ll move
over to the right a little.”</p>

<p>He kicked his rudder bar, shoved his stick over
ever so slightly, and sat listening. “Dot dah,
dot dah, dot dah,” sang the ear phones, but
presently the signal changed. “Dah, dah, dah,
dah, dah,” it went. He was back on the course.</p>

<p>“Gee, but I’m glad I’m flying in the year
1929, and not half a dozen years ago,” thought
Jimmy. “I’d soon be way off my course and
never know the difference if I didn’t have this
radio set. I tell you, a compass doesn’t help
much when there’s a cross-wind. Half a dozen
years ago, before there were any radio beacons,
I’d have had to make this trip by dead reckoning,
and I’d probably have landed in Connecticut,
or Massachusetts, or any old place except Long
Island.”</p>

<p>He flew on, listening carefully to the buzz of
the radio beacon, and intent upon his task. He
was pleased to know that his friend, the forecaster,
had taken so much trouble on his account.
He would have been still more pleased could he
have known to what extent the weather man was
laboring in his behalf. For after Jimmy left the
Cleveland Airport, Beverly Graham sat down at
his desk and devoted himself to doing all that he
could to get Jimmy through in safety.</p>

<p>Suddenly Jimmy heard a sharp signal, sounding
above the dull buzz of the directional beacon.
A smile of satisfaction flitted over Jimmy’s face.
“I’m right over Brookville,” he muttered.
Quickly he glanced at his clock, then made a
rapid calculation. “I’m right on the line and
right where I ought to be at this minute,” he
thought. “I’m making almost exactly 150 miles
an hour.”</p>

<p>What he had heard was a marker beacon. At
intervals along the airway, radio signals are sent
up vertically, just as they are sent horizontally
from the radio beacons at Cleveland, Bellefonte,
and Hadley Field. These vertical radio beams
are audible only for the brief spaces of time it
takes a plane to sweep over the stations sending
them. The present signal was gone almost as
soon as Jimmy heard it, but it gave him a world
of information and assurance. It told him, not
merely that he was on the line, which he already
knew, but it also told him the exact point on that
line which he had reached. He soared onward
with increased confidence.</p>

<p>Intently he watched his instrument board.
From time to time the radio beacon warned him
that he was being blown from the direct line, and
he nosed his plane back to the path. Everything
seemed to be going well. His clock told him that
he should be nearing Bellefonte, the half-way
point between Cleveland and Hadley Field.
Also, the radio signals were now so much more
powerful that he knew he must be close to the
beacon emitting them.</p>

<p>For some time Jimmy rode with only the roar
of his own engine and the buzzing of the radio
beacon reaching his ears. He was certain, however,
that he must be near Bellefonte. The
radio beacon signals came so loudly. Suddenly,
above the steady buzz of the directional beacon
came the sharp signal of the Bellefonte marker
beacon. Jimmy drew a breath of relief. “Halfway,”
he muttered, “and everything as fine as
silk.”</p>

<p>Hardly had he heard the marker beacon before
a voice sounded in his ears: “This is Bellefonte
Weather Bureau speaking to Jimmy Donnelly,
of the New York <span class='it'>Morning Press</span>. As nearly as
we can judge by the sound of your engine, you
are directly over the field. Fog continues bad
throughout Pennsylvania. Wind remains
unchanged—southwest, twenty-five miles an hour.
Conditions much better after you pass the mountains.
Some fog in New Jersey and may be
more before you get there.”</p>

<p>Instantly Jimmy answered through his sending
set. “This is Jimmy Donnelly speaking to
Bellefonte,” he said. “Your message received.
Thanks ever so much. Have you any information
about weather between Hadley Field and
Long Island?”</p>

<p>“No,” came the reply, “but will tell Hadley
to get latest information and talk to you as you
go by. Good luck to you.”</p>

<p>“Please tell Long Island I am coming,” said
Jimmy. “I ought to hit there about ten o’clock.
Please ask the radio man there to listen in for
me about that time. I’ll get in touch with him
after I pass Hadley. Thanks ever so much.”</p>

<p>Jimmy went sailing straight on through the
fog. Ahead of him lay the worst place on the
entire mail route, the Woodward Pass. But he
was light of heart. He knew where he was, he
knew how high he had to be to pass safely over
the mountains, and he had no fear of losing his
way. Had he been left to reckon out his position
himself, he would have been worried and
uncertain, no matter how regularly his propeller
turned, no matter how accurate his clock. But
with the radio keeping him on the course and
telling him the precise moment when he passed
over Bellefonte, there could be neither doubt nor
uncertainty. So he flew on, almost jubilant.
He was making the schedule he had set for himself.
He felt sure he was going to succeed.</p>

<p>On he went, carefully watching his instruments,
and trying to figure his position from
moment to moment. Now he felt sure he was
past the mountains beyond Bellefonte and flying
over the lovely Penn’s Valley. In a few minutes
he was approaching Woodward Pass. He pictured
Winkelblech Mountain rearing its great
bulk directly in the line of his flight, where he
should turn to the right and shoot through the
pass. But to-night he was not shooting passes.
He was thousands of feet above the pass. Suddenly,
for the merest fraction of a second, he
thought he saw a gleam of light. It must have
been the beacon on Winkelblech, he thought,
shining through some rift in the fog. In a few
moments he knew he must be past the mountains
and sailing over the beautiful Buffalo Valley.
But only his instruments told him so. Below him
he could see nothing but fog.</p>

<p>Ahead of him lay more mountains—wicked
ones, too, through the great reaches of the anthracite
coal field, where the earth is as rough
and rugged as the outside of a black walnut
shell. But the furrows in the earth are great
mountain ridges, and the wrinkles are hills and
precipices.</p>

<p>On he flew, following the radio beacon intently,
watching his time, calculating his position.
He could see absolutely nothing. He
wanted to see nothing but the instruments before
him, for it was almost terrifying to look out into
the fog. His instruments seemed friendly to him.</p>

<p>Now he felt sure he was over Sunbury. One
hour more would bring him to Hadley Field, for
it was exactly 150 miles between the two points.
In half an hour, three quarters of an hour at
most, the worst part of the trip would be over.
The Pennsylvania mountains would be passed,
and underfoot would lie the flat agricultural
lands of New Jersey, where he might hope to
land in safety if he were forced down, though
there seemed to be little chance of that.</p>

<p>He rushed on through the night. Ahead of
him, he knew, the country was far less rugged
for a distance. The mountains melted into hills
of perhaps eight hundred feet elevation, and
there were many farms and smooth fields. But
soon after he should pass Elysburg, just ahead,
the land would rise up sharp again, in hills
twelve hundred feet high. Beyond them was
lower land once more, and then the ridges climbed
up, just before Ringtown was reached, until their
summits towered two thousand feet aloft. Little
did Jimmy care about that. He was far, far
above them. The mountains meant nothing to
him. Already the marker beacon at Numidia
was sounding in his ears. Soon, now, he would
be entirely past the mountains.</p>

<p>Suddenly he noticed that his engine was beginning
to heat. He glanced at his oil gauge and
found that it was no longer working. Instantly
he looked at his tachometer. His engine speed
was falling rapidly. Jimmy opened his throttle.
There was no answering response from the engine.
Instead, it beat slower and slower. It was
making twelve hundred revolutions per minute.
It fell to nine, then seven hundred. His ship
slowed dangerously. He began to lose altitude.
There was nothing to do but come down. Otherwise
he would soon fall. He decided to try to
make the landing field at Numidia. Then he
saw that he could not do it. The wind at his
back would prevent it. His engine was too weak
to fight the breeze. It would blow him far to
one side of the little landing field.</p>

<p>An icy feeling grew about Jimmy’s heart.
He knew what was coming—a forced landing
among the mountains, in the densest sort of fog.
Already he was far down in the mist clouds.
Vision was absolutely cut off. For a single
instant he felt numb, almost paralyzed. Then he
rallied all the skill he had, to fight for his life.</p>

<p>The next landing field was at Ringtown. It
was only eleven miles from Numidia to Ringtown,
and he had already passed over part of the
distance. He must make the landing field at
Ringtown. He must keep his ship in the air
until he could reach that field. If only his trouble
had occurred a bit sooner, he could have made the
field at Numidia. The marker beacon would
have helped him to get down to the right spot.
How he was going to tell where the Ringtown
field was, in this awful fog, Jimmy did not know.
He could not even guess.</p>

<p>Between him and Ringtown were those stern
and beetling hilltops—those mountains that
towered heavenward for two thousand feet.
Could he get over them? With his face drawn
and serious Jimmy glanced at his altimeter. He
was still well above that height, but he was losing
elevation steadily. Could he get over those
mountain crests? Could he find the landing field
if he did get over?</p>

<p>Suddenly he thought of his radio. He put the
mouthpiece to his lips. “This is Donnelly of the
<span class='it'>New York Press</span>,” he said firmly and evenly.
“I am between Numidia and Ringtown. My
oil line has gone bad. My engine is failing.
I am losing altitude fast. I am trying to get
over the mountains west of Ringtown and land
at that field. May need help.”</p>

<p>Jimmy had no idea whether or not any one
would hear his call. Ordinarily the radio men
would not be listening in for messages. Yet
there was a chance that they might be listening
to-night, because of the very bad weather. But
Jimmy was reckoning without Beverly Graham.
The moment he found that Jimmy had a sending
set, the latter had issued orders that a constant
watch be kept on the air. Hence Jimmy’s message
came to waiting ears. The Bellefonte radio
man caught it.</p>

<p>He didn’t even wait to answer Jimmy. There
is no caretaker at the little Ringtown landing
field. The Bellefonte operator knew that. But
he snatched up his telephone and tried to get a
connection with a man at Ringtown who had
control over the field. The telephone operator
was a long time in getting the connection. When
finally the Bellefonte operator got his man, he
said hastily: “A flier is making a forced landing
at your field right away. See if you can do something
to help him.”</p>

<p>But meantime, though the operator almost
failed in his effort to get help for Jimmy, help
from another source was at hand. Johnnie Lee
had gotten Jimmy’s parachute message and read
it. When night came on, and he saw what the
weather was like, he doubted very much if Jimmy
would attempt to return to New York. But if
Jimmy did fly over, Johnnie wanted to signal
him. He wanted his old friend to know that he
had received his message. He knew that it was
idle to attempt to send a message up through the
fog with so impotent a thing as his flash-light.
And so for a long time Johnnie had been at work
preparing for a bonfire.</p>

<p>Fearful of setting fire to his father’s buildings,
Johnnie had been stacking up old boards
and rails on top of a pile of old wood that stood
close to one edge of his father’s farm, and almost
adjoining the landing field. He had thrown coal
oil on the pile, saturating it thoroughly, and he
had a bucket of gasoline all ready to throw on
the heap before he touched a match to it.</p>

<p>But that was not all. As Jimmy had suspected,
Johnnie had a radio sending set, like most
of the other members of the Wireless Patrol. It
would not carry his voice so very many miles, but
Johnnie knew it would carry well enough for him
to hold a conversation with Jimmy as the latter
neared Ringtown. Even now he was at his radio,
listening. He had been there for some time. He
had caught the weather forecast from Bellefonte.
He felt sure that if Jimmy had left Cleveland,
he ought to be nearing Ringtown. So he listened
hopefully yet fearfully. And suddenly he caught
the very message that galvanized the Bellefonte
operator into action. Jimmy was calling for
help. He was near at hand. He was trying to
make the Ringtown field, but there was nothing
to guide him.</p>

<p>The instant Jimmy stopped speaking, Johnnie
sent a call speeding through the air. “Jimmy
Donnelly,” he said. “This is Johnnie Lee speaking.
I heard your call for help. I have a big
bonfire ready to light. I will touch it off at once.
Maybe you can see it through the fog. The landing
field is just beyond it. Is there anything else
I can do to help you?”</p>

<p>Instantly there was an answer. “God bless
you, Johnnie. Light your fire quick. I’m coming
down fast, but I believe I’m going to clear
the mountains. Get your fire lighted quick.”</p>

<p>Johnnie did not tarry a single instant. Out of
the house he darted and away he rushed across
the fields to his pile of wood, heedless of the dark
and the fog. He knew the way perfectly and
his flash-light helped him to avoid loose stones.
He reached his beacon without a fall or a twisted
ankle.</p>

<p>Grabbing up his bucket of gasoline he threw it
over his pile of wood. Then he struck a match
and tossed it toward the heap. There was a terrific
burst of flames that shot fifty feet into the
air. Then the oil-soaked pile of wood caught fire.
The flames soared upward. The fire grew intense.
The oily wood burned with terrific heat.
The glare of the flames lighted the entire region.
Even through the fog the flare of the fire could
be seen for a long distance. It turned the mist
into glowing clouds. It shone through rifts in
the fog, like the electric beams of searchlights
penetrating the openings between cloud masses.</p>

<p>Suddenly Johnnie thought he heard the drone
of a motor. Then the sound faded away. The
noise of the fire drowned out more distant sounds.
The snap and crackle and hiss and roar of the
burning heap shut out every trace of the hum of
a propeller. For a moment Johnnie stood near
his beacon, vainly straining his ears for some further
trace of an airplane. Then he ran hastily
off to one side. Again he heard the faint drone
of a motor. Then the sound died away. But
Johnnie felt sure he had not been deceived.
Jimmy was going to make it. He was going to
reach the field in safety.</p>

<p>Again Johnnie strained his ears, to catch another
shred of sound. A puff of wind brought
him what he was listening for, loudly, unmistakably.
Once more the sound died away. But
Johnnie knew he had not been mistaken. He had
heard an airplane. Suddenly the sound came to
him with startling distinctness. He strained both
ears and eyes as he peered upward through the
fog.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a bright glow aloft. Johnnie’s
heart stood still. He listened for an explosion.
He was frozen with horror. The plane
overhead—Jimmy’s plane—was afire. He gazed
fearfully into the concealing fog to see where the
plane was falling. He saw it coming down with
a rush, flaming fiercely. The cloud of fog was
all aglow with the brilliant light. It shone even
brighter than Johnnie’s bonfire. Regardless of
what might happen to him if the plane exploded,
Johnnie rushed toward the spot where it was apparently
going to crash. Johnnie reached the
place. He paused, looking upward. He held
his breath, waiting for the smash. Down came
the glowing light to the earth. Johnnie let out a
yell of relief. It was not the plane that had fallen,
but a flare that Jimmy must have dropped.</p>

<p>Quickly Johnnie looked aloft again. He stared
through the fog banks. Dimly he saw something
glowing. He watched, breathless. Almost instantly
the glow over his head became two
luminous spots in the mist. They grew brighter
fast. Now Johnnie was certain he knew what
he was looking at. The luminous spots were the
landing lights of a descending plane. They
seemed to be jumping right at him. Johnnie
knew the plane was coming straight toward him.
It was almost upon him. He leaped to one side.
He was not a moment too soon. The descending
plane swished past him, seemed to rise lightly,
then leveled off, hit the ground heavily, bounced,
came to earth again, and went rolling and jolting
straight across the landing field.</p>

<p>Johnnie raced after the ship. It came to rest.
A figure stepped from the cabin. Johnnie raced
toward the man.</p>

<p>“Hello!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Hello yourself,” came the answer. “Who
are you?”</p>

<p>“This is Johnnie. Thank God you got down
safe.”</p>

<p>They clasped hands and stood silent.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>CHAPTER VII</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:1.0em;'>A Forced Landing in a Fog</p>

<p>For a second the two old friends held each
other’s hand. Then some one was heard
running toward them. A man appeared in the
fog.</p>

<p>“It’s the man who looks after the field,” said
Johnnie, as soon as he could distinguish the approaching
figure. “I suppose he heard you land
and has come to help.”</p>

<p>The man rushed up. “Are you all right?” he
asked anxiously. “Did you get down without
much damage?”</p>

<p>“Don’t believe I broke a thing,” said Jimmy.</p>

<p>“You know my plane is built with unusually
strong underpinning. Let’s take a look at her.”</p>

<p>Johnnie’s bonfire gave them enough light to
see by. Quickly they examined the plane. Nothing
was wrong externally.</p>

<p>“Let’s take a look at the oil line,” said Jimmy.
“Something went wrong with it.”</p>

<p>He reached into his plane and drew out his
flash-light. “Hold it,” he said, shoving it into
Johnnie’s hand. Then he turned and opened the
cowling of his engine.</p>

<p>With practiced eye he glanced along the length
of the oil line. At first nothing wrong was apparent.
But on the bottom of the engine compartment
was a telltale pool of oil. Jimmy
twisted his head and got a look at the underside
of the oil line. The pipe was cracked open along
the seam. The crack extended for several
inches. Practically all the oil had dripped from
the engine.</p>

<p>“Vibration must have done that,” said Jimmy,
as he turned to his companions and explained
what was wrong. “Likely it happened when I
went west this afternoon, for I flew the ship
pretty hard. I suppose the seam gave way then,
and the hard trip to-night has opened it up. Have
you got any tire tape, Johnnie?”</p>

<p>“Plenty of it,” said Johnnie. “I’ll fetch you
some.”</p>

<p>“Bring all you can get,” shouted Jimmy after
the fast-disappearing Johnnie. “And arrange
for some oil. I’ll need a lot. Hurry as fast as
you can, Johnnie. I mustn’t lose a minute.”</p>

<p>Jimmie stepped into the cabin of his ship and
threw open a locker, in which he carried odds and
ends that might be useful to him in just such an
emergency as this. There were rolls of tire tape
here. Jimmy grabbed them. In another moment
he was rapidly taping the broken pipe-line.
Over the actual opening in the seam he wound
several thicknesses of the tape. Then he began
to twist the stuff around the remainder of the little
pipe. There was no telling how soon the rest
of the seam would open, and Jimmy meant to
play safe. He used all the tape he had, and when
Johnnie came back with additional rolls, he added
these to his reinforcements. When all the tape
was wrapped, he breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe we’ll lose any more oil,” he
said, “even if the whole seam opens up. She’s
wound tight and thick. Now, how about oil?
Could you get any?”</p>

<p>“Dad’s bringing all we have,” said Johnnie.
“We buy it in thirty-gallon barrels, as we can
get it so much cheaper.”</p>

<p>“Thank heaven you’ve got plenty of it,” said
Jimmy. “It’ll take a lot. How is your father
going to get it here?”</p>

<p>“On the truck,” said Johnnie. And even as he
spoke they heard the chugging of a motor and a
farm truck came nosing through the fog.</p>

<p>Jimmy stepped to the truck and greeted Mr.
Lee. “It’s mighty kind of you to help me out,”
he said. “I thought I was done, when I was
forced down. But now I can take off again and
I can still get to New York on time. I’ll lose
half an hour here probably, but there’s still time
enough if I don’t have any more trouble.”</p>

<p>Johnnie filled the oil tank as fast as he could.
Jimmy snatched the opportunity to look his
motor over. Everything seemed to be right.
Then he watched the oil gauge and told Johnnie
when to stop pouring oil. He made everything
tight about the cowling, gave the ship a final inspection
under the rays of his flash-light, and
stepped into his cabin.</p>

<p>Now he would know whether he might possibly
still succeed in his enterprise. He was fearful
that the engine might have overheated and been
injured when it was running with insufficient oil.
Would it start now? And if it started, would it
run? Could he depend upon it? Would it have
power enough to lift him from the ground?
Could he trust it to raise him high enough aloft
to clear the mountains so close in front of him?</p>

<p>Fearfully Jimmy pressed the starter. There
was an explosion, the propeller turned over once
or twice and stopped. Jimmy’s heart almost
stopped with it. The engine was ruined. It
would not go. He had failed in his effort. He
had lost his big opportunity. All these thoughts
flashed through Jimmy’s mind. Then came another.
“It’s got to go,” he muttered.</p>

<p>He choked the engine and again touched the
starter. For a moment the starter whirred noisily,
but the engine did not explode. Then there
was a bang, the propeller whirled madly about,
and the engine began to hum smoothly.</p>

<p>“There wasn’t any gas in it the first time,”
thought Jimmy.</p>

<p>Then he sat and listened. His motor ran as
well as ever it had run. It was purring as
smoothly as a sewing-machine. He ran his eye
over his instrument board. The oil gauge was
registering now. Everything looked right. He
did not take time to make his usual tests. Throttling
down his engine, he leaned from the cabin.</p>

<p>“A million thanks, everybody,” he said. “I’ll
get into touch with you later. I’ve got to be off
this instant or I’ll be late with my stuff. Goodbye
and good luck to you all. Thanks ever so
much.”</p>

<p>He closed the cabin door and stepped into the
pilot’s seat. The engine began to pick up. It
beat faster and faster. Presently the plane
started to roll forward, very slowly. Jimmy
drove it straight on until he could see the little,
low boundary lights that marked the edge of the
landing field. He drove the ship close to them,
turned it about to head it into the wind, then went
charging blindly back across the field through
the fog, almost straight at the reddish blur that
he knew was Johnnie’s bonfire. His engine functioned
perfectly. He gathered speed. Suddenly
the plane lifted from the ground and soared
almost directly above the blazing pyre. For a single
instant it was visible in the red mist above the
flames. Then it vanished from view in the fog as
a stone disappears beneath the water.</p>

<p>Inside the plane Jimmy sat tense. His first
effort was to gain elevation. Before him, at almost
no distance, the hills once more reached an
elevation of 2,000 feet. He had to climb a thousand
feet to reach their tops, another thousand to
be safe. But there was this factor in his favor.
He was flying with the wind. The air would
rush upward when it struck the slopes of the
mountains and he would be borne upward with
it.</p>

<p>But Jimmy was not waiting for any ascending
currents of air to carry him aloft. He opened
his throttle wide and climbed as rapidly as he
could push his ship upward. For a few moments
he thought of nothing else. He wanted to gain
altitude. With every second he breathed more
easily. His altimeter showed him he was mounting
fast. Now he was at 1,300 feet, now 1,500,
now 1,800, now 2,000. Up he went. His altimeter
registered 2,500 feet. Jimmy knew he was
safe. No hilltop in the region towered so high.
At 3,000 feet he felt still better. But he did not
stop climbing until he was thousands of feet aloft.</p>

<p>All the time he had been climbing, Jimmy had
also been trying to keep on his course. The radio
beacon made that easily possible. All the time
it had been singing in Jimmy’s ears, “dah, dah,
dah, dah,” and Jimmy thought he had never
heard sweeter music.</p>

<p>Assured of sufficient elevation, certain that he
was on the line, Jimmy felt sure that nothing
could now prevent him from reaching his goal.
He was elated. He might have broken his landing
gear at Ringtown. The plane might have
nosed over and damaged his propeller. He might
even have crashed. Any one of these things might
have happened and one of them almost certainly
would have happened, had it not been for Johnnie
Lee’s beacon. Added to the light of the revolving
beam from the landing field tower and
his own flare, it had enabled Jimmy to get down
safely. It wouldn’t matter if he did smash his
landing gear when he came down on Long Island.
He would then be at his destination.</p>

<p>So Jimmy sailed ahead jubilantly. And his
jubilation increased as he flew along. He knew
just where he was. He glanced at his clock, to
check the time, and ran his eye over all his other
instruments. Everything seemed to be working
right.</p>

<p>Meantime, the forces on the ground had not
been idle. The moment that Jimmy took off
from Ringtown, the man who had helped Jimmy
there hurried to the telephone and informed the
Bellefonte radio man that Jimmy had landed
safely at Ringtown, had repaired a leak in his oil
line, and had taken off again. At almost the
same time word came to Bellefonte to the effect
that a plane had just passed over the Park Place
beacon. That was reassuring news, for it told the
watchers that Jimmy had gotten safely aloft once
more.</p>

<p>On he went, boring through the fog. To this
he gave small heed. His entire attention was
centred on his instrument board. He watched
that like a hawk. From his turn and balance
indicator, which told him when he was on a level
keel and was flying straight, his eyes jumped to
his tachometer, to his oil gauge, his oil temperature
gauge, his altimeter, and so on from instrument
to instrument. But most often his eye fell
upon the oil gauge. Despite his confident remarks
about the security of the pipe-line, he was
none too sure that he would not have further
trouble with it. But none developed, though
Jimmy soared along, mile after mile.</p>

<p>A half hour passed. Jimmy had his eye on his
clock. “We ought to be close to Easton,” he
thought. He glanced out through the fog,
though he had no hope of seeing anything but
mist. Nor did he see anything else. Yet the mist
had a luminous quality he had not noticed at any
other time. He sped on and presently the mist
lost its luminous effect. For a moment Jimmy
was puzzled. Then a look of inquiry came to
his face. “Could that have been from the lights
of Easton?” he thought. “If it was, the fog is
not so dense.”</p>

<p>He flew on. The radio beacon kept him
straight on the course. His clock and his tachometer
assured him that he was well past Easton.
He felt easier in his mind. There were no more
mountains to face. The waves of land that make
Pennsylvania so rugged were flattening out. Nowhere
before him, Jimmy knew, were there hills
higher than 800 feet and soon he would be over
country as flat as a sea on a calm day. The
thought cheered him. His radio signals were
growing much stronger. He knew that meant
that he was approaching Hadley Field. He began
to peer out into the mist, hoping to find it
lessening.</p>

<p>Presently a bright flash of light shone for a
second against a bank of fog. Jimmy almost
cried out with joy. It was the beam of a revolving
beacon. Soon he saw another flash of light.
He began to descend and came down cautiously
until he was within a thousand feet of the earth.
And now he could see, here and there as he flew,
luminous patches in the fog. He knew well that
these bright spots were the lights of towns. He
calculated his position and slowly dropped down
another hundred feet.</p>

<p>He knew now that he was nearing Hadley
Field. All about him were Jersey towns. He
could begin to make them out more plainly. The
mist was no longer in unbroken clouds. It was
growing thin and stringy. Occasionally through
a rift in it he could catch a clear glimpse of lights
on the ground. And now he began to see the
beams of the revolving lights at frequent intervals.</p>

<p>He decided to try to talk with the Hadley radio
man. Picking up his mouthpiece, he sent forth
a call: “Jimmy Donnelly, in the
<span class='it'>New York Press</span> plane, calling Hadley Field.”</p>

<p>The call was answered as soon as he had done
speaking. “Hadley Field answering Donnelly,”
came the reply, sharp and crisp. “Is everything
all right with you?”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t be better,” replied Jimmy, “except
for fog. That is growing less. What can you
tell me about the weather between
here and Long Island?”</p>

<p>“It improves all the way. Long Island just
told us that there was almost no fog there.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you ask them to have a taxi ready
for me when I arrive,” said Jimmy. “I’ve got
to rush some films to the <span class='it'>Press</span> office.
I mustn’t lose a minute.”</p>

<p>“We’ll call them right away and tell them you
want a taxi. Have you any idea where you are?”</p>

<p>“I ought to be near—why, there’s your neon
light and the beacon over the hangar. Now it’s
gone again. I must be very close to Hadley. It
didn’t seem to be more than two miles away.”</p>

<p>“We can hear your motor,” came back the
reply. “We’ll tell Long Island you’ll be there
very soon. Good luck to you. We’ll call them
at once.”</p>

<p>Plainer and plainer Jimmy could see the glowing
lights below him. He dropped down another
hundred feet. Suddenly he heard the marker
beacon at Hadley Field. Now he was sure he
knew where he was. There were the lights of
New Brunswick. Beyond was Metuchen. Much
farther away was a glow that must be Perth
Amboy. Jimmy thanked his lucky stars. No
longer would he have the radio beacon to direct
him. He must find his own way. Unless fog
arose immediately, there would be no difficulty
about that. In a few minutes he would be at his
airport.</p>

<p>The radio beacon had already ceased to beat
in his ears. He was past Hadley Field. He set
his course direct for his destination, noted the
compass direction, and flew on. Soon he was over
Staten Island. He flew above the Narrows and
was over Long Island. Below him for miles
glowed the lights of Brooklyn. His plane rushed
on like an eagle. Soon Brooklyn was behind him.
His own field lay just before him. There were
fog clouds and shreds of fog, but it was easy
enough to see down between them. Another half
hour, Jimmy knew, would probably put the whole
island under a deep blanket of fog. He had
often seen the fog making up as it was now. But
he cared nothing at all about what conditions
would be like in half an hour. For he was home.
His landing field was just under him.</p>

<p>He nosed his ship downward, shut off his
power, and came down in a long glide. The field
was well lighted. He could see the earth perfectly.
He put his ship down in a three point
landing, and rolled across the turf. Then he
taxied rapidly to his hangar, gave a shouted order
to fill the gas and oil tanks, threw off his
parachute, grabbed his camera, and rushed out to
the waiting taxi. In another second he was
speeding toward Manhattan.</p>

<p>It still lacked several minutes of his deadline
when he rushed into the <span class='it'>Press</span> office and
laid his story on the city editor’s desk. A copy boy ran
to the photograph department with his camera.
Jimmy sank into a seat. He suddenly felt weak.
He was all atremble. It was the let down after
the tremendous strain he had undergone.</p>

<p>The managing editor came walking out of his
office. He held out his hand and shook Jimmy’s
warmly. “It was a fine piece of work, Jimmy,”
he said. “Handley telegraphed us about you
and the bad night. We have followed you all the
way across. You had us pretty badly frightened
when you told Bellefonte your engine was failing
and you were making a forced landing in the
mountains. And our relief was great when we
found you were patched up and on your way
again. It is equalled only by our pleasure in
seeing you.”</p>

<p>Jimmy looked abashed. Then he lost all sense
of self-consciousness as the thought of Johnnie
Lee popped into his head.</p>

<p>“I might not be here now, Mr. Johnson,” he
said, “if it had not been for my old friend Johnnie
Lee. It was his bonfire that saved me. Without
it I should almost certainly have crashed. I
owe my life to him and the <span class='it'>Press</span> owes its
pictures and its story to him. He wants to be a
reporter, Mr. Johnson. Can’t you help him?
Haven’t you a job for him?”</p>

<p>“Has he done any reporting, Jimmy? Has he
had any experience?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. But he is clever enough. He could
learn quickly, if you would give him a chance.
And I have no doubt he would be glad to work
for very little pay or maybe none at all until he
learned how to do the work. Can’t you take him
on, Mr. Johnson?”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Jimmy, I’ll gladly send him a
check for his help to-night. We are always willing
to pay anybody who helps us get news. But
we have no use for green reporters here. We need
trained men. We seldom hire cubs any more.
We want men with experience.”</p>

<p>“But you took me on,” protested Jimmy,
“and I was perfectly green.”</p>

<p>“You came on as a flier, Jimmy. And you
would be the last man in the world to say you
were green at that job.”</p>

<p>“But I learned how to get news. So could
Johnnie.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you did, Jimmy. You picked up the
knack readily. And if you continue to improve,
you’ll make a great reporter some day. But you
evidently had it in you.”</p>

<p>“Maybe Johnnie does, too.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Jimmy. We can’t possibly take
him on. But if he got some experience—if he
showed us that he knew how to handle a story—I
might give him a chance. I feel very much
indebted to him. It was a great thing for you to
get through with that story, even if you were
delayed.”</p>

<p>Jimmy looked alarmed. “The story will make
the edition, won’t it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Absolutely. And we’ll scoop every other paper
in town on pictures. The only other pictures
in the city were sent by wire, and they aren’t
half as good as actual photographs. What’s
more, we’ll have one feature that no other paper
in the country will have. That is the story of how
the <span class='it'>Morning Press’</span> flying reporter dared a fog
that stopped even the Air Mail, and got through.
The story is already in type, Jimmy.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>CHAPTER VIII</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:1.0em;'>Jimmy Saves a Boyhood Friend</p>

<p>Jimmy was almost startled at the managing
editor’s announcement. Then he felt embarrassed.
It had never occurred to him that his
paper would print the story of his flight. He
had not thought his flight worth telling about.
In fact, he had not thought of anything except
getting back with the news. Had not Handley
wired the managing editor about the perilous trip
Jimmy was making, and had not that enterprising
individual gotten into touch with the Airways
Weather Bureau and urged its personnel to do
everything possible to insure Jimmy’s safety, the
tale would probably never have been known in
the <span class='it'>Press</span> office. For Jimmy would doubtless
have walked in and apologized for being delayed.
He would probably have said that he had had
engine trouble and had landed at Ringtown to
fix an oil pipe that was leaking. That would have
been just like Jimmy. And no one would have
known the difference.</p>

<p>But the managing editor, despite his accustomed
gruffness and sharpness, was at heart the
kindest of men. His harsh exterior was merely
a mask he wore. He was fond of Jimmy. He
had been truly worried about his flying reporter.
He understood Jimmy well enough to know that
the lad would make every effort humanly possible
to get back with the photographs and the story.</p>

<p>Indeed, that was the real reason he liked
Jimmy so much. Loyalty and enthusiasm
counted greatly with the managing editor. And
he knew that Jimmy was one hundred per cent.
faithful. So he had taken the matter of Jimmy’s
flight in hand, and had done all he could to help
his pilot get through. By telephone he had been
kept informed of the lad’s progress, and he had
even been in conversation with the field worker
at Ringtown. That was how he knew all about
the matter. Ordinarily he had little to say to any
one by way of commendation or praise. But this
time he forgot his own rule of “not spoiling good
reporters by praising them.” He had spoken
from his heart.</p>

<p>There really wasn’t much danger of the managing
editor’s spoiling Jimmy, or of anybody
else’s doing it, for that matter; because Jimmy
was so intent on doing something, on accomplishing
something, on getting ahead and climbing up,
that he had little time to think about the things
he had done. What interested Jimmy was the
things he <span class='it'>hoped</span> to accomplish. He was always
studying how to be a better flier and how to gain
more ability in his new task as a newspaper man.</p>

<p>For a short time he had no assignments that
taxed his abilities in either direction. He took the
<span class='it'>Morning Press</span> camera man out to take pictures,
on several occasions; he transported photographs
himself; and he did one or two little tasks of reporting.
But things moved so slowly for several
days after the flight from Cleveland that time began
to hang heavy on Jimmy’s hands and he was
growing restless for a task that seemed to him
worthwhile.</p>

<p>It came, as most newspaper stories come,
unexpectedly. Early one evening an A. P. “flash”
was received, saying that a great dam had burst
in northeastern New Hampshire. A town had
been partly wiped out by the wall of water that
poured down the narrow valley. Scores were
dead or missing. Hundreds were homeless. It
was a disaster of the worst kind.</p>

<p>Managing Editor Johnson saw at once that
this was no mere local story. This was a story of
the widest interest. It was almost a “national”
story. The destroyed town was far up in the
northern part of the State, is a rough and rugged
region. It would be utterly impossible to get one
of his own men there in time to get a story for the
next day’s paper. He would have to depend upon
local correspondents. Fortunately the <span class='it'>Press</span> had
a correspondent at Berlin, which was not many
miles distant from the wrecked village. Mr.
Johnson ordered this correspondent to the scene
at once, and made what arrangements he could
with the telegraph company to expedite the
handling of the despatches that might be filed.
Then he called up Jimmy.</p>

<p>“We have just had a flash from the A. P.,”
he said, “about a dam that has burst north of
Berlin, New Hampshire, partly wiping out the
town of Northend. It won’t be possible for you
to do anything to-night, I suppose, but I wish
you would take off at daybreak and get up there
as quick as you can. The place is in the very
peak of the State. It’s the northernmost town.
We will get the general story through the A. P.
and I have sent our Berlin correspondent. But
we want a story by a staff member. Get all the
incidents you can—the sort of stuff you and
Handley gathered at Cleveland—and in particular
get lots of pictures. We need the pictures
especially. Get back here at the earliest moment
you can.”</p>

<p>“All right, Mr. Johnson,” said Jimmy, “but
I won’t wait until morning. I’ll take off at once.
I can follow the New York to Boston lighted airway
and stop at Springfield for the night. I
know the way well. I could go all the way, but
I don’t know anything about the airports up in
the White Mountains. I might have trouble in
landing. So I’ll stay at Springfield for the night
and hop off from there at dawn. That will get
me there early in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Good,” replied the managing editor. “That
ought to get you back here by late afternoon.
Good-bye and good luck to you.”</p>

<p>Jimmy hopped off as soon as he could get
ready. He was glad to be in the air again, happy
to have a real task ahead of him. To be sure,
there was nothing apparently difficult about this
job. There was plenty of time, and the work
ought to be easy. But Jimmy already knew
enough about newspaper work to understand that
one can never tell what will develop in any story.
Before he got through with it, this assignment
might bring him some thrilling experiences. At
any rate, here was another chance to make good.
This time he was wholly on his own.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the night was perfect. In flying
language it was a “C. A. V. U.” night—a
night with ceiling and visibility unlimited. Not
a cloud flecked the sky. The deep blue inverted
bowl of the heavens seemed immeasurable. Myriads
of stars hung in the firmament. So clear was
the atmosphere that they made the night luminous.
Indeed, the stars alone would have lighted
the earth. But a glowing young moon added its
brilliant beams, making the night almost like day.
It was an evening to gladden a pilot’s heart.</p>

<p>It did gladden Jimmy’s. He felt so gay and
frolicsome that he could hardly refrain from
doing a few barrel rolls, or looping the loop, or
in some other way giving expression to his mood.
But when he remembered that he was a fully
accredited member of the staff of a great newspaper,
and saw that it would not be seemly for
a real reporter to be doing somersaults like a
child, he restrained himself and flew along soberly
enough. Yet his heart was singing gaily.</p>

<p>It was little more than nine o’clock when
Jimmy hopped off from the Long Island airport.
He had only a trifle more than 100 miles to go.
He could make it easily in an hour, and in much
less time if he chose to do so. But there was no
call for haste, and Jimmy didn’t want to get to
Springfield too soon. He was enjoying the night
and the ride altogether too much. So he flew
along at a lazy gait.</p>

<p>He had crossed the upper part of New York
City, so that he could fly over the East River
rather than the Sound. And he had picked up
the line of beacons that marks the airway from
Newark to Boston. Ahead of him he could see
revolving beacon after beacon, at ten-mile intervals,
as one sees street lamps stretching along a
city boulevard. The way was as evident as
Broadway at noon. But on a night like this
Jimmy didn’t need any lights on earth to guide
him. The beacon lights in the heavens would
have guided him anywhere.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that he reached Hartford,
the capital city of Connecticut, in no time. Below
him he could see the lights of the city, stretching
in long rows for miles, like orchards of lights.
Ever so plainly he could see the familiar landing
field, where the pilots stop to pick up mail. It
was all aglow with its encircling white boundary
lights, its green lights that show the descending
pilot the best way of approach, its red markers
on top of buildings and telephone poles, to tell
the pilot where danger lurks aloft, and its clustered
lights and beacons at the hangar. Jimmy
had been there often and knew the place well.</p>

<p>From Hartford to Springfield was such a mere
hop that Jimmy didn’t want to stop when he
reached the latter city. If he could not play, at
least he could express his feelings by extending
this wonderful flight a trifle. He wondered
where he should go. Then he thought of an old
friend—a lad he had not seen for a long
time—another member of the Wireless Patrol—Carl
Dexter.</p>

<p>Jimmy had visited him once, after Carl moved
away from Pennsylvania. He knew where Carl’s
home was. It was in the town of Wilbraham, in
Massachusetts, only a few miles from Springfield.
Of course, Jimmy had no hope of seeing
Carl, but he thought he would fly over the lad’s
home and take a look at the region. He liked it
greatly, and it held pleasant memories for him.
If he could not see Carl he could at least drop
him a note, saying that he had passed in the night.
Perhaps Carl might even see his plane and remember
about the incident. He would circle
around the place and perhaps the family might
notice his plane. So, instead of landing at
Springfield, Jimmy remained in the air.</p>

<p>He flew lazily over the city, to take a look at
it by moonlight. He could see everything plainly.
There was the peaceful Connecticut River, asleep
under the rays of the moon, and the brightly
lighted memorial bridge that crossed it. At a distance
rose the high tower he had had in mind as a
guiding light, with its great lamp glowing aloft.
And only a few miles distant, shining almost level
with his eyes, was the flashing beacon on Mt.
Tom. It was all familiar to Jimmy. He was
glad to see it again.</p>

<p>When he had flown over the city, he banked
sharply to the right and turned to the east, trying
to pick out the clustered lights of the village of
Wilbraham, which was less than nine miles distant.
In five minutes he was over the place. Just
beyond, he could plainly see the bulk of Springfield
Mountain. It lay dead ahead of him. At
the foot of it he saw a long line of lights that
marked the country highway. Here and there
shone the lamps of snug little homes. On the
slope of the mountain scattered lights betrayed
the presence of other country dwellings. If he
kept straight on, Jimmy would have to fly right
over the mountain. But just now he had no
intention whatever of attempting to fly over the
mountain. He kicked his rudder and shoved his
stick over until he was flying parallel with the
ridge. Then cautiously he began to descend. He
was trying to find the house in which his friend
lived. It was on the slope of the mountain, perhaps
a mile or two from the village. Jimmy recalled
that fact distinctly.</p>

<p>He dropped down as low as he dared. He was
within four hundred feet of the ground. He
could see every feature of the landscape sharply
in the bright moonlight. But it was a little difficult
to pick out one particular house, when he had
visited the neighborhood only once and had never
seen the region from the air. So he had to swing
about in a great circle. That took him a little
closer to the mountain than he had intended to fly.
But the air was calm and he did not anticipate
any danger.</p>

<p>Now, as he circled close to the slope of the
hill, he saw, here and there, little homes tucked
away in little farms on the wooded side of the
mountain. The moonlight glistening on the dewy
roofs made them shine out startlingly.</p>

<p>But suddenly he saw something that made him
catch his breath. From a window of one of these
hillside homes flames were licking upward. At
first Jimmy doubted his own eyes. But a second
glance told him he was not mistaken. The flames
grew swiftly in intensity, and leaping tongues of
fire were soon shooting from several windows.
Even from his position high in the air Jimmy
could see that the fire was in the first floor of the
building. The flames were now lighting the place
up brightly.</p>

<p>Jimmy came down a little lower and circled
above the house. Nowhere could he see a sign of
life. He glanced at his clock. It was almost
ten-thirty. “All abed and sound asleep,” muttered
Jimmy. “They’ll all be roasted sure if
some one doesn’t waken them.”</p>

<p>He circled lower. Nowhere could he see a soul.
Yet the place had the appearance of being inhabited.
Close by, in the barnyard, Jimmy saw
cattle. Then he <span class='it'>knew</span> the place was occupied.
Now he saw a dog running about excitedly.
Meantime, the flames grew brighter and brighter.
The first floor windows were fairly belching
smoke and flames.</p>

<p>Something must be done to save the family so
sound asleep in this isolated home. For a second
Jimmy glanced about to see if there was a field
handy where he could land. It was some distance
to the nearest one. Whatever was to be done
must be done instantly. There was no time to
hunt out a landing place.</p>

<p>Without a moment’s hesitation Jimmy circled
back toward the house. He shoved his stick over
and nosed his plane downward. Then he gave
her the gun. The ship shot earthward like a
meteor. She gained tremendous speed. Jimmy
flew her straight at the blazing house. When he
was so close it seemed as though he could not
possibly avoid crashing into the structure, he
pulled back on his stick and zoomed up over the
housetop, his engine beating with a thunderous
roar.</p>

<p>Swiftly he circled and bore back toward the
doomed habitation. Again he dived at it, like a
hawk after a pigeon, and again he zoomed up over
the housetop. His engine, racing at full speed,
set the mountain to echoing with mighty reverberations.
The dog, the poultry, everything that
could make a noise was adding to the uproar, so
terrified were they.</p>

<p>Now Jimmy came close to the house and on
level keel circled as close to it as he could. All
the while his engine was thundering at high speed.
Round and round he circled, watching the place
closely, hoping that he would accomplish his purpose
before it was too late.</p>

<p>At last he saw a head poked from a window.
Another followed. The family was at last awake.
Jimmy drew a breath of relief and instantly lifted
his plane to a higher altitude. He had gotten
dangerously close to the tree tops.</p>

<p>There was nothing more he could do in his
plane. He wanted to help these unfortunate
folks. Perhaps the barn and the live stock could
be saved, even if the dwelling was doomed. But
Jimmy could give no assistance in a plane. He
must get to the ground.</p>

<p>He flew out toward the open farm land. There
were fields everywhere. Most of them were too
little for his purpose. But not far away he saw
a field that seemed to stretch for hundreds of
yards along the roadway, which here parallels the
mountain. Jimmy could see it plainly in the
moonlight. It looked smooth and safe. Jimmy
judged it was a mowing, or hayfield. He
swooped toward it. At the far end of the field
he could dimly discern on a little ridge of land
a great barn with a huge silo. A low white dwelling
rose between it and the road. The sight reassured
him. The field <span class='it'>must</span> be a smooth mowing.
He felt certain now that he could land in
safety. He circled, so as to approach the field
again from the lower end, dropped a flare,
switched on his landing lights, and came down
sharply over the trees that lined the end of the
field. He could see well. He noticed that the
field sloped upward slightly toward the distant
house and barn. Bringing his plane down almost
to the earth, he straightened her out, and just as
his wheels were about to touch the ground lifted
her nose a trifle. A second later he set her down
perfectly, shut off his gas, and let the ship roll up
the little slope to a standstill.</p>

<p>Jimmy was out of the ship and out of his
parachute like a flash. But already near-by
dwellers were collecting around his plane.</p>

<p>“There’s a house on fire on the mountain,”
cried Jimmy. “Everybody in it was sound
asleep until I woke them a moment ago. They
need help. They may be burning to death.
Come on. Who knows the way?”</p>

<p>“This way,” shouted a lad who had just come
up. “Follow me.”</p>

<p>The entire group raced after him, as he ran
down the highway, then turned into a wood road
that led directly up the slope of the mountain.</p>

<p>Now it was plain enough that something was
burning. Through the trees shone a red glare,
and the sky above was rosy with the flames.
Showers of sparks could be seen shooting skyward.
The wood road appeared to lead directly
toward the burning house, which was located at
no great distance from the main highway.</p>

<p>Up the road they raced as fast as they could
travel. The entire countryside seemed to be
lighted by the fire. In no time they reached the
burning building. The first floor was a mass of
flames, and the fire was rapidly eating its way
to the roof. The owner had escaped, with his
wife and two children; but a grown lad, who
slept on the third floor, was trapped and could
be seen leaning from an attic window. The
father was trying to rescue him.</p>

<p>He had gotten a ladder, but it was many feet
too short. There was no apparent way to reach
the lad. The father was part way up the ladder.
He was calling to the boy to jump into his arms.</p>

<p>“Wait!” cried Jimmy, as he rushed up.
“Don’t do that. You’ll both be hurt. There
must be some other way.” His mind was working
fast. An idea came to him. “Have you a
rope?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Sure. A long hay rope.”</p>

<p>“Let me have it quick,” said Jimmy. “We
can save him with that.”</p>

<p>The rope was fetched. From his pocket
Jimmy took a ball of twine he had been using
back at his hangar. The twine was thin but
strong. He picked up a long, thin stone, tied one
end of the twine to it, called to the lad in the
window to catch it, and threw the stone up to
him. The first attempt failed. Jimmy threw the
stone up again and the lad caught it. Jimmy
tied the twine to the hay rope. Fearful lest the
heavy rope break the twine, he mounted the ladder
almost to its topmost rung, gathered up a
great length of the rope to take the weight from
the twine, and held the rope up toward the lad
above him.</p>

<p>“Pull it up carefully, but hurry,” he said.
“It’s hot on this ladder.”</p>

<p>Quickly the lad hauled up the twine, then carefully
raised the rope until he could clutch the end
of it. A cry of relief went up from the watching
crowd as he grasped the rope. The lad disappeared
within the attic, dragging the rope
behind him. In a moment he reappeared at the
window, slid out over the sill, and on down to
the ladder. He had fastened the rope within the
attic. Jimmy tarried on the ladder until the lad’s
feet were firmly planted on a rung. Then he
scrambled to earth, quickly followed by the lad
he had rescued.</p>

<p>Once they were on the ground, the lad turned
to Jimmy and held out his hand. Both boys gave
a cry of astonishment. The lad who had just slid
down the rope was Carl Dexter, Jimmy’s old
friend in the Wireless Patrol. They grasped
hands eagerly and greeted one another in a manner
that astonished the crowd.</p>

<p>“Carl!” cried Jimmy. “I had no idea that
was you. The light was so flickering and uncertain,
and your hair is rumpled and I just didn’t
recognize you. I didn’t know your father, either,
but that is not strange. He has grown a beard
since I saw him. I suppose I have grown so in
the years since we met that he didn’t know me
either. I’m awfully glad to see you. It has
been more than two years since we met.”</p>

<p>“No more than I am to see you, Jimmy. But
it’s terrible to see you under these circumstances.
How did you get here? What brought you
here?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you all about that later,” said Jimmy.
“We’ve got to try to save the barn just now.
The house will go sure.”</p>

<p>They ran to the endangered structure and
found most of the neighbors battling hard to protect
it. A bucket brigade had been formed.
Water was being thrown on roof and wall. The
dwelling was absolutely doomed. In the end,
after a hard battle, the firemen succeeded in
saving the barn, some other outbuildings, and all the
stock and implements.</p>

<p>When a lull came in the fire fighting, Jimmy
and his old friend drew off to one side, and
Jimmy began to tell Carl how he happened to be
flying in the neighborhood and how he discovered
the fire. Suddenly he stopped talking and a
strange look came into his face. He seemed to
be debating something in his mind.</p>

<p>“Carl,” he said, “I’m in a queer position. I
have no business to be here at all. I ought to be
in Springfield. My managing editor thinks I
am there. Gee! He might even have been trying
to get me. He may have some orders for
me. I never thought of that. I could slip right
back there and maybe he’d never know the difference.
But here’s a story. It’s a good story,
even if I did have a part in it. The <span class='it'>Press</span>
ought to have it. Maybe we can scoop the other
New York papers on it. I’m going to shoot it
in as quick as I can, no matter what the Old
Man says about my taking too much rope. He
can fire me if he wants to. But I’m not going
to see the <span class='it'>Press</span> beaten on its own story. Gee!
He’d fire me for that, sure. How can I get to a
telegraph office quickest?”</p>

<p>“In a motor car, I should think. Thank
heaven the barn didn’t burn. Our car is in it.
I’ll pull on some trousers and——By Jove! I
don’t own any trousers. They are all burned up.
I’ll go as I am. And I’ll get you to the telegraph
office as fast as gasoline will take us.”</p>

<p>He did. Jimmy ran into the office and began
to write. He handed the sheets to the operator
as fast as they were written, with the injunction
to rush the stuff. The operator ticked off the
story as Jimmy wrote.</p>

<p>Because he was full of the matter, and because
he could see so vividly in his mind the scene he
was describing, Jimmy once more wrote a
gripping story. He told in simple words how
the pilot of the <span class='it'>Morning Press</span> plane, flying over
Wilbraham, had noticed flames issuing from a
hillside home; how the pilot had awakened the
sleeping inmates by diving at the house with
roaring motor; how later the pilot and a farm
boy had saved the life of a lad trapped in the
third floor of the burning building; and how this
rescued youth had proved to be a lifelong friend
of the pilot.</p>

<p>“Gee,” said Jimmy, when he had finished the
story, “I slipped up there. I forgot to get the
name of that farm boy. I’ll let it go now, but
I’ll be more careful next time.”</p>

<p>Then he wrote another message. It was to
the managing editor.</p>

<p>At once the managing editor got into touch
with him by telephone.</p>

<p>“We have further news about the New Hampshire
flood,” he said. “It’s even bigger than I
thought. I’m sorry I didn’t send another man
with you.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a friend here,” answered Jimmy,
“who could help me if you are willing. It’s the
lad we just saved from the fire. He’s an old
friend. I can make good use of him. Shall I
take him?”</p>

<p>“Get anybody you can who can help you,” was
the answer.</p>

<p>Jimmy called out to Carl: “Could you go on
up to New Hampshire with me and help me cover
a flood story?”</p>

<p>“If they can spare me at home, I’ll go gladly
if it will help you any.”</p>

<p>Jimmy turned back to the telephone. “I think
it is all right, Mr. Johnson,” he said.</p>

<p>“Very well. Make all the speed you can.
This is a big story and all the papers will be
after it hot. Use the telegraph or the telephone
if you break down. Make sure that we get the
story and get it in plenty of time. And don’t
forget that we want good pictures. They are
more important than the story. We’ll get a story
from the A. P., anyway. The telegraph editor
tells me you just sent in a rattling good story
about a fire. Keep it up. Get us an even better
one about the flood. Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>CHAPTER IX</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:1.0em;'>Covering a Great Flood by Airplane</p>

<p>When Jimmy explained to Mr. Dexter that
he needed help the next day and had asked
Carl to assist him, Mr. Dexter reluctantly consented
for Carl to go with him. Carl was really
needed at home in this emergency, for there
would be much to do. But Mr. Dexter was so
grateful to Jimmy for saving his son’s life, and
for perhaps saving all their lives, that he did not
feel as though he could refuse the request. So
it was settled that Carl and Jimmy should take
off at dawn the next morning.</p>

<p>Neighbors lent the lad some shoes and clothes.
And though these did not look very well, they
answered the purpose all right. The question of
shelter for the night was solved with equal ease.
Neighbors took the homeless family into their
own homes. Jimmy wanted to be near his plane.
The lad who had guided Jimmy from his plane to
the burning home said that his grandfather lived
in the white house by the mowing where the plane
was standing, and would be glad to take the two
fliers in for the night. So Jimmy and Carl found
themselves housed for the night in a very comfortable
home, close by the airplane. They were
assured that no one would molest the ship, for
the big farm dog would drive off all intruders.</p>

<p>Relieved in his mind, Jimmy prepared to get
some sleep, in preparation for the hard day he
foresaw for the morrow. But before he went to
bed, he got out his maps and studied the topography
of the region over which he had to fly the
next day. Northend, the town that had been
wiped out by the flood, was some miles north of
Berlin. It was at the lower end of a little valley,
which was almost entirely surrounded by mountains.
The Androscoggin River flowed through
the little city.</p>

<p>“It’s plain enough what has happened,” said
Jimmy to Carl. “There must have been a dam
up the river and it gave way. There was no
place for the wall of water to go but straight
through the heart of Northend. These two
mountains at the southern end of the town are
like the shoulders of a bottle. There’s only a
narrow neck between them, for the water to pass
through. If this jammed up with debris, the
whole town would be under water.”</p>

<p>They studied the map in silence for a few
moments. “Gee!” said Carl. “There’s plenty
of mountains up there. How are you going to
get there?”</p>

<p>“We’ll fly directly up the Connecticut River,
between Vermont and New Hampshire, until we
pass South Columbia. Then we’ll fly east past
the mountains until we strike the Androscoggin.
We’ll follow that stream south to Northend.
What we’ll do for a landing-place I don’t know.
The map doesn’t look very promising. But I
suspect we can pick out some place that will
answer. Anyway, we’ll cross that bridge when
we get to it. But you can remember to watch for
possible landing-places after we leave the Connecticut
to-morrow. That’s a rough country up
there in northern New Hampshire.”</p>

<p>Their thoughtful hosts looked after the lads’
every need, even to lending them an alarm clock.
Soon the boys were sound asleep in a bed as soft
as down. It had been an exciting day for both
of them, and each was ready for slumber.</p>

<p>When the alarm rang, Jimmy sat up in bed
indignantly. “Confound that thing!” he said.
“Something’s wrong with it. We haven’t been
abed ten minutes.”</p>

<p>But his watch showed him that the only thing
wrong was his own sense of time. It was almost
dawn. The boys arose instantly and dressed
quietly, so as not to disturb their hosts. They
tiptoed down-stairs, their shoes in their hands.
But when they reached the kitchen there was a
surprise in store for them. Their hostess was not
only up and dressed, but a substantial breakfast
awaited them. Jimmy hardly knew what to say
or how to thank her. She told him the best
thanks would be for the two boys to eat a good
breakfast. In that way they thanked her heartily
enough. Then, bidding their kind hosts goodbye,
the two lads hastened to the plane, started
the engine, and soon hopped off.</p>

<p>Straight to Springfield they flew, and there
Jimmy landed and had his supply of gasoline and
oil replenished. Then they took off for the north,
sailing straight up the valley of the Connecticut.
On another occasion Jimmy would have been
glad to fly leisurely along this beautiful river and
enjoy the fine scenery. But to-day he had no
time for anything but his job. Well he knew
that hard on his heels would come rushing a whole
company of newspaper men, if indeed some of
them had not even preceded him in the dark. His
job was to get to Northend as quickly as he
could, and collect the material he needed. An
hour’s start, he knew well, would make all the
difference in the world to him. So he opened his
throttle and pushed his ship along at a fast pace.
He had considerably more than 200 miles to
go, for he was playing safe by doubling around
the mountains instead of flying directly over
them. But in considerably less than two hours
he had covered the route selected and was flying
south along the Androscoggin, close to Northend.
So far he had not seen a plane anywhere, and he
believed he was the first news flier to reach the
scene.</p>

<p>As he came south along the little river, the
land began to rise in swelling heights to right
and left, and the level bottom-land became narrower
and narrower. Presently the <span class='it'>Morning
Press</span> fliers found themselves almost surrounded
by mountains. It was like flying through a
break in the side of a bowl into the bowl itself.
Ahead of them, behind them, and to right and
left of them, mountains rose, steep, rugged,
and menacing. And in the very centre of this
bowl-like valley lay Northend.</p>

<p>At the present moment the valley was in very
truth a bowl, for it was fairly covered with water.
From mountain to mountain the water reached,
and what had been the city of Northend looked
like a collection of tiny islets in the centre of
the vast lake. Individual houses and blocks of
buildings lifted their dark roofs above the turbid
waters.</p>

<p>“Makes you think of huckleberries floating in
a bowl of milk,” Carl shouted to Jimmy.</p>

<p>And that was what the scene did resemble.
The huckleberries, of course, were houses. In
the centre of the town the buildings rose in solid
blocks, like squares of brown bread that had
gotten in with the huckleberries. But in the
residential districts the houses stood apart, well
separated, and on the very outskirts of the town
they were farther and farther apart. Isolated
homes rose from the flood out in what must have
been the suburban or rural regions. Nowhere
within the limits of the city was there a foot of
dry ground visible.</p>

<p>“It’s terrible,” shouted Jimmy. Carl nodded
his head.</p>

<p>Jimmy made a complete circle around the little
valley, at a good elevation. From that height he
and Carl could see everything. Their vision
ranged from mountain to mountain, unobstructed.
Nowhere was there another plane.
Nowhere was there evidence of activity, save in
one or two places where small boats were being
navigated from house to house. Jimmy was
thrilled at the thought that he was the first outside
correspondent actually to reach the scene. He
resolved that he would also be the first to take
to the outer world an eye-witness story of the
disaster. He knew he must work fast to do it.
Other newspaper men would soon be on his heels.
They would be coming in droves.</p>

<p>“Get my camera,” he shouted to Carl, “and
take a snap or two of the scene. Get a picture
that shows the whole valley under water, with
Northend in the centre of it.”</p>

<p>Carl could handle a camera, and leaning
through an open window, he got several good
pictures. The rising sun was shining down into
the valley by this time, illuminating it well.</p>

<p>Now Jimmy brought his ship down in an easy
glide until he was not more than 200 feet above
the flood. He flew back and forth over the town.
Carl snapped pictures as they flew and Jimmy
watched every feature of the scene before him.
Now he could see many people looking out of
the upper floors of their homes. He could trace
the course of the river by the line of debris and
wreckage. For the flood had gone tearing
through the city, wrecking, smashing, demolishing
everything in its pathway. Before it had
been swept a vast mass of material, consisting of
outbuildings, uprooted trees, broken telephone
poles, railroad ties, old boats, wooden bridges,
sawlogs, pulp timber, porches, fences, boardwalks,
demolished homes, and a thousand other
objects that the rushing waters had wrenched
loose or broken down or torn up. And all this
mass of debris, jamming at the bottle neck, had
backed the water up and submerged the town.
Jimmy had read his map aright.</p>

<p>As he flew, Jimmy made mental note of striking
things he saw. Here was a house tilting at
an unbelievable angle, its underpinning evidently
washed away. Here were motor cars standing
on their roofs, only their four wheels showing
above the flood. Here were the remains of an
iron bridge that must have weighed scores of
tons. Yet the iron work was rolled into a great
mass, like a ball of rope, and the whole thing
rested on a smashed front porch of a home. The
entire front of the house was caved in by the
force of the blow struck by the iron. Here were
railroad cars turned upside down.</p>

<p>Through the centre of the town was a wide
gap between rows of buildings. At first Jimmy
did not catch the significance of this. He thought
it was the river bed. Then something reminded
him of the stream as he had seen it a few miles
above Northend. There it was only a little river,
a few rods wide. This breach in the centre of
the town was of vast width. Suddenly Jimmy
understood. Whole blocks of houses had been
washed away. They must be jammed up with
the other debris at the bottle neck below. He
shuddered at the thought. The loss of life must
have been appalling.</p>

<p>Along either side of this wide pathway of
death, the flood waters had left their marks.
Debris of every conceivable sort had been washed
up on either side of the furrow the flood had
plowed through the town, and there a million odd
things had lodged. Old boxes, chicken-coops,
boards, timbers, door-steps, wooden gates, tin
cans, and a multitude of other things had been
forced in between houses or up on porches, or
through first floor windows, until the scene was
terrible beyond description. It was plain enough
where the wall of water from the broken dam had
gone surging through the town. Like a giant
among pygmies, it had mowed down everything in
its path.</p>

<p>Back and forth Jimmy flew over the distressed
city. On the flat tops of business buildings he
saw many people. The upper floors of buildings
seemed to teem with people. On the hills opposite
the town he now saw figures moving. He
judged they were people who had reached the
heights before the flood overwhelmed the city, or
else they were folks from the neighborhood who
had come to the assistance of the marooned townspeople.
Long ago, all those who could be rescued
had been rescued, or had gone to their deaths.
How many of them there were and who they
were Jimmy could not even guess. But he knew
the total must be terrible. He could not help to
save anybody, but he could get into touch with
the survivors and get the story of the disaster.
He began to look about for some means of accomplishing
this end.</p>

<p>Near the centre of the town was a building
that stood up one or two stories higher than any
other structure in the city. It was a great
squarish building, that looked as firm as Gibraltar.
Jimmy had noticed it as soon as he reached
the town. He couldn’t help noticing it. And he
also saw that there were people on the flat roof.
Now he flew toward this building, dropping as
low as he dared to come. Suddenly his eye shone
with pleasure. On the front of the structure he
caught sight of a large sign, with the gilded
name “Northend <span class='it'>Daily News</span>.” He glanced at
the group of people on the roof. He was so
close to them that he could almost tell the color
of their eyes. To his astonishment he saw that
a desk had been carried to the roof, together with
many chairs, and that a man was seated at the
desk, busily typewriting.</p>

<p>The sight stirred Jimmy’s heart. “It’s the
editor of the Northend <span class='it'>News</span> writing the story of
the flood. I’ll bet a dollar it is,” thought Jimmy.
“If only I can get that story, the <span class='it'>Morning Press</span>
will have the biggest scoop in years.”</p>

<p>He pulled out a pad and scribbled on it as he
flew: “Have you the story of the flood? Can I
get it from you? I am from the New York
<span class='it'>Press</span>.” Then he turned to Carl. “In my tool
kit you’ll find a large spool of safety wire,” he
said. “Get that out, put a weight on it, and tie
this note to it.”</p>

<p>Carl fished out the wire, weighted one end of
it with a monkey-wrench, and tied the note to it.
Then Jimmy headed directly into the stiff breeze
which was coming up, and when they neared the
building again throttled his engine down until the
ship seemed hardly to have any forward motion.
Carl, meantime, had paid out the wire. Several
men on the roof grabbed for the message, but all
missed it. Jimmy made a circle and once more
flew over the roof. This time some one caught
the note.</p>

<p>Jimmy circled the town and flew back over the
<span class='it'>News</span> building. Now he saw white marks on the
roof. Some one had been making great letters
with a piece of chalk. They were a message for
him. This is what they said. “Have entire
story. Press room flooded. Have made mats.
Can you take to Berlin and arrange to have
edition printed and sent here? A truck can reach
west side of town by the hill road.”</p>

<p>When Jimmy read that he couldn’t suppress
a whoop. “Carl,” he cried. “Just think! He’s
got the story set up and the mats made for casting
the stereotype plates. If we can get those
mats, we can get proofs of the whole story. It’ll
be the beat of the year.”</p>

<p>He scribbled another note. “Will land and
try to reach you. Have everything ready. Will
fly to Berlin with the mats and make arrangements
for edition for you.” The next time he
flew over the <span class='it'>News</span> building, this message was
skilfully dropped by Carl and caught by the
group on the roof.</p>

<p>“They got it,” shouted Carl.</p>

<p>Jimmy smiled and nodded. Then he pulled
back on his stick, lifted his plane to a higher
elevation, and went soaring straight toward the
nearest hillside, looking for a possible landing-place.</p>

<p>On a hillside farm he found a place that looked
favorable. Twice he flew over the place studying
it. The ground seemed rough. He was
fearful of it. But he saw no better place and
decided to chance it. He came down in a long
glide, barely missing some trees. Then he
straightened out for a landing. His plane was
just skimming the ground, and Jimmy was waiting
for it to lose flying speed when he noticed a
low stone wall at the other end of the field.
Jimmy knew he was overshooting too much to
dare attempt to kill his surplus speed by fish-tailing.
He burst the gun wide open and eased
back on the stick. In a second the ship was once
more over the tree tops, and Jimmy circled back
again into the wind for another try at the field.
He did a nose high slip and then proceeded in
disgust to pancake her in. It was a dangerous
move, even for the most skilled pilot, for always
there is danger of falling off on one wing, due
to a lack of flying speed. The ship was settling
vertically. Just before she hit, Jimmy burst the
gun half open to give her a little more forward
speed, so she would not settle so hard on her
undercarriage. Then she struck, but not hard
enough to break anything. Rapidly she came to
rest. With a sigh of relief he throttled down his
engine and climbed from the plane. He let his
motor idle for a few minutes, then cut the switch.</p>

<p>“We’ll go over to those folks yonder and talk
to them,” he said, starting toward a group of
people who were doing something at a distance.</p>

<p>They hurried to the workers. A number of
people who lived on the hills were busy making
rafts at the water’s edge to rescue the marooned;
for there were many folks in the flooded area
whose position was still precarious. Jimmy
talked to the workers. They told him the story
of the breaking of the dam. This was a huge
reservoir in the hills, only a short distance above
the city. Continuous rains to the north had
swollen every brook and rivulet until the impounded
water had reached a threatening height.
There was anxiety about the dam, but no actual
fear of its breaking. Then suddenly, without
warning, the dam had slid from its foundations,
releasing the entire body of water at once. That
was what made the catastrophe so awful.</p>

<p>A wall of water thirty feet high had swept
down the valley. Naturally it followed the trough
of the Androscoggin. That stream, already bank
full, could not hold another drop. The result was
appalling. Straight through the town the huge
wall of water had gone, thundering and destroying,
smashing and devastating, sweeping away
houses as though they had been chips. Whole
blocks of buildings, on either bank of the stream,
had been picked up and swept down-stream.
Jimmy’s guess was correct.</p>

<p>Scores had been killed or were missing. Had
the disaster occurred in the daytime, it might
have been possible to save many of them. But
coming as it did, just at nightfall, the flood had
done its worst. To venture out into the roaring
waters in the dark was sheer suicide. There had
been some rescues. They told Jimmy about those
they knew of. There had been many deeds of
daring. Jimmy learned the stories. Now a great
effort was being made to save those who were still
in danger. For the waters were yet deep and the
current swift. Indeed, in the centre of the town
the water was still eight feet deep and sweeping
along swiftly, cutting away ground, undermining
houses, uprooting poles, and spreading destruction.
The work of rescue had been made
difficult through the loss of boats. Most of the
boats in the town had been swept away in the
first fierce rush of water.</p>

<p>There was one little boat at hand. It was a
rickety, sorry-looking craft, and it evidently
leaked badly. But still it was a boat. Jimmy
looked at it. He decided that it would hold
together for a few hours longer.</p>

<p>“Who owns this boat?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“I do,” said a farmer. “But it ain’t much of
a boat. I caught it in the flood last night.”</p>

<p>“I’ll give you five dollars for it for one hour,”
said Jimmy.</p>

<p>“You can have it,” said the farmer, “but I
warn you it ain’t safe to get in it. We tried it
and had to come back. The thing almost sunk
with us.”</p>

<p>“We’ll try it,” said Jimmy. “Got something
we can bail with?”</p>

<p>The farmer got them an old pail. There were
oars in the boat. Jimmy got two strong poles
from a pile of wood that lay near.</p>

<p>“Come on, Carl,” he said, stepping toward the
craft. “Let’s empty her.”</p>

<p>They drew the boat ashore and turned it on its
side. When the water had run out, they pushed
the craft into the flood, stepped carefully into it,
and shoved off. The farmer’s description had not
been exaggerated. Water began to seep into the
boat rapidly.</p>

<p>“Take the oars and row as hard as you can,
Carl,” said Jimmy. “I’ll bail and tell you how
to pull.”</p>

<p>Carl began to row rapidly, and Jimmy started
to throw out the water. By bailing vigorously
he could just about keep up with it. They made
good progress until they came to the built up
part of the town. Here the water rushing between
the houses caused eddies and delaying currents.
But they kept on steadily, Jimmy telling
Carl which way to pull, while he himself tossed
out bucket after bucket of water. Without the
bucket they would have sunk in a short time.</p>

<p>They drove straight out toward the street on
which the <span class='it'>News</span> building stood. There they
turned and floated straight down the street with
the current. The waters were still tearing along
between the houses at a terrifying rate. It was
appalling to think what it must have been like
when the flood was at its crest. There was little
to do now except bail and steer. There was still
plenty of drifting debris in the water, and this
made it dangerous. Always there was the chance
that some half sunken log, swirling up beneath
them, would overturn their boat and catapult
them into the flood.</p>

<p>They drew near the <span class='it'>News</span> building. “We’ve
got to be sure we make it,” said Jimmy. “If
we are carried past, it will be a deuce of a job
getting back. Get your rope in hand. Put your
oars in the boat. I’ll steer her with a pole. Grab
a window-frame. I’ll knock out the glass if
necessary.”</p>

<p>They drew swiftly near the <span class='it'>News</span> building. It
had suffered, like every other building in town.
The water was up to the second story. Apparently
it was going to be difficult to make a landing.</p>

<p>“Get ready now,” cautioned Jimmy. “If we
miss her, I’ll try to shoot the boat around the
corner of the building. There’ll be an eddy
there. Grab anything you can catch hold of,
and hold fast to your rope.”</p>

<p>Jimmy forced the boat toward a second-story
window. The window was closed. It looked as
though they would have a hard time to make an
entrance. Jimmy raised his pole to smash the
glass. He was just about to strike, when the sash
was flung up and a man’s head thrust through the
window.</p>

<p>“Give me your rope, quick,” said the man.</p>

<p>Carl thrust out his hand with the rope. The
man took the rope and carefully snubbed the
boat. “Look out,” he cried. “Watch that you
don’t get thrown out.”</p>

<p>The boat swung round in the current and came
to rest alongside the building. Jimmy and Carl
climbed carefully through the window, helped by
the man within.</p>

<p>“We are the fliers who dropped you the message,”
said Jimmy. “We’ve come for the mats.”</p>

<p>“Good,” said the man. “Come up on the roof
and talk to the boss.”</p>

<p>They ran up the steps to the roof. There sat
the man Jimmy had seen at the desk. He was
still typewriting. Jimmy made himself known.</p>

<p>“I’m from the New York <span class='it'>Morning Press</span>,” he
said. “Tell me about the flood, and about your
own situation and what you want me to do.”</p>

<p>“No use to tell you anything,” said the editor.
“Every word I know about the flood is already
in type. You can have complete proofs of it if
you will take my mats to the office of the Berlin
newspaper and get them to print the edition. I
want 5,000 copies. They can send them back here
by truck or any way they wish, but I must have
them at the first possible moment. We’ll establish
headquarters over on the shore, near the place
from which you started. We’ve been watching
every move you made. That’s near the highway
that skirts the west side of the valley. Tell them
to send their papers there just as quick as they
can get them printed. By that time the water
will have gone down some and maybe altogether.
They are making arrangements to dynamite the
jam at the gorge below town. That will let the
water drain out.”</p>

<p>Meantime, a printer had been wrapping the
mats up carefully in oiled paper. Another man
had attached a long rope to Jimmy’s boat and
had worked the boat around into the eddy at the
down-stream side of the building. Still another
printer came to the roof with duplicate sets of
proofs for Jimmy.</p>

<p>The latter assured the <span class='it'>News</span> editor that he
would not fail to carry out his commission. “I
ask just one thing,” he said. “Give me an assurance
that I have a start over the next reporter.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do that,” said the editor. “I can’t hold
out any news, if any reporter questions me, but
I’ll give out no more proofs. That’s only fair.
It’s in return for your help. Now you’ll have to
be hurrying, for there comes your first competitor.”</p>

<p>Jimmy whirled and looked upward. Sure
enough, there was another plane coming down the
valley.</p>

<p>Jimmy delayed only long enough to talk to
some of the men on the roof. He soon found they
knew little except the general story of the flood.
They were all employees of the <span class='it'>News</span>. All had
been at work in the building when the flood overwhelmed
the town on the previous evening.
They had remained there because they believed
they were safe in the big steel and stone structure.
But reporters had managed to get abroad
and before the telephone lines were all down they
had telephoned in dozens of stories about the
flood. Later some of them had made their way
back to the <span class='it'>News</span> building in a boat, with detailed
stories of rescues, deaths and drownings, heroic
acts, and the names of the flood victims whose
bodies had been recovered and identified. And
now Jimmy had proofs of all their stories, together
with all the tales he and Carl had picked
up, and their photographs and mental pictures of
what was left of Northend.</p>

<p>No wonder Jimmy wanted to be off with this
treasure trove, when he saw a competitor winging
toward the town. Bidding farewell to the
<span class='it'>News</span> editor, Jimmy and Carl carefully entered
their boat, bailed it, and shoved off. The trip
back was even harder than the journey out to the
<span class='it'>News</span> building, for now Jimmy had a great roll
of mats to keep dry. He was forced to bail with
one hand. It was difficult work to keep up with
the incoming water, but he toiled like a Trojan
and almost kept up. By the time they reached
the shore there must have been two inches of
water in the boat, but that meant nothing to
either lad.</p>

<p>Jimmy paid the farmer for the use of his boat.
He delayed a little to ask further questions about
the flood, and picked up additional incidents; for
several people had joined the rescue group while
he and Carl were gone. Just as Jimmy was
starting for his ship, he saw that the other airplane
was landing close to where his own ship
stood. He delayed to see who the newcomer was.
He was sorry enough he had waited, when the
latter stepped from his plane. It was Rand, a
man who formerly worked for the <span class='it'>Morning
Press</span> and who had been discharged by Mr. Johnson
because he utterly failed to solve the problem
of the air mail bandits, whereas Jimmy had uncovered
the whole story.</p>

<p>Even before that event occurred, Rand had
disliked Jimmy. But since Rand had been discharged
by the <span class='it'>Morning Press</span> he had hated
Jimmy with malignant intensity. He had done
everything he could, at every turn, to trick and
discredit him. And Jimmy knew well that the
fellow would hardly stop at anything to accomplish
his purpose. Now Jimmy walked briskly
by him, merely nodding. But Rand answered
the nod with a cutting oath.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Jimmy and Carl hopped off
for Berlin. Almost straight south they flew, with
the Milan Hills on their right and the Chickwolrepy
Mountain on their left. It was no distance
at all to Berlin. At least, it took almost no
time at all to reach that city. But Jimmy had to
circle several times before he was willing to land.
Even then he was fearful of the result. For the
only place that looked possible was the flat land
along the river, and this had been under water.
Even yet there were little pools here and there
in the depressions. Jimmy was afraid his plane
might bog down and nose over. If it did, that
was the end of his flight—the flight that promised
so much for him.</p>

<p>For a moment he was tempted to go on, and
mail the mats back from the next town. But he
had promised to put them in the hands of the
Berlin editor. Jimmy always tried to make his
word as good as his bond. So now, after studying
the ground carefully, he picked out the most
promising looking spot and came down in a long
glide. Just as his ship was about to hit the
ground, he gave her the gun for a second, to increase
her momentum, set her down on three
points, and held his breath. The field was not as
wet as it looked, and the mud was only surface
mud. His ship rolled safely to a stop.</p>

<p>Jimmy was out of her in a flash. Throwing
off his parachute, and leaving Carl to guard the
plane, he hurried off with his mats. In no time
he found the editor of the Berlin paper, delivered
the mats and the message, and was back at his
ship. But on the way he had stopped at a garage
to engage some gasoline. Soon a tank wagon
rolled up, and Jimmy’s tanks were quickly filled.
Then, waving good-bye to the circle of admiring
small boys, Jimmy hopped off.</p>

<p>A great, bald-faced, precipitous hill rose to the
west of the town. Jimmy circled over the city,
to gain altitude. Below him he noticed the great
pulp mill and the enormous pile of pulp wood,
that rose like a little mountain close beside the
river. The whole atmosphere was redolent of the
sulphur used in making paper.</p>

<p>But Jimmy had little interest now in sightseeing.
The instant he had gained sufficient altitude,
he darted away to the west, shot between
the hills, and sped straight as an arrow to Lancaster,
the nearest town on the Connecticut.</p>

<p>Then he banked to the left and with throttle
opened wide went roaring down the valley of that
river, over the same route by which he had come.
He dropped Carl at Springfield, after getting his
promise that when things were straightened out
at home Carl would come to New York to visit
him.</p>

<p>Again he took off, and this time he did not
come to earth again until he landed at his home
field. A taxi once more took him to the <span class='it'>Press</span>
office, where he delivered his news proofs and
films to the city editor, then sat down and for a
long time worked industriously at his typewriter,
putting down on paper the description of what
he had seen and learned at Northend.</p>

<p>His trip back to Long Island was a pleasant
one. Again he had been equal to the occasion.
Once more he had made good. But there was one
memory of his recent trip that left a bad taste in
his mouth. That was the thought of Rand. On
several occasions now he had gotten the better of
the fellow. Each time Jimmy had triumphed
over him, Rand had made his hatred more evident,
had tried meaner tricks to thwart Jimmy.
But never before had Rand cursed him at sight
or seemed so venomously hostile.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to watch him carefully,” thought
Jimmy. “He is vicious enough to do most anything.”
And Jimmy was right, as coming events
were to prove.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>CHAPTER X</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:1.0em;'>Jimmy Visits a Lightship off the Coast</p>

<p>For some time after his flight to Northend
Jimmy found life rather tame. No really
big stories happened in the eastern part of the
country. So Jimmy was occupied from day to
day with minor tasks that provided little excitement.
Yet all the while he was learning more
about his job. From day to day he talked with
fellow pilots at the Long Island airport, and
drew from them as much as he could in the way
of helpful suggestions about flying. For some
of them had had extremely trying experiences.
Whenever he was with newspaper men Jimmy
asked as many questions as he could about reporting
and news coverage. He bore in mind what
the managing editor had said to him: “If you
continue to improve, you’ll make a great reporter
some day.” It was Jimmy’s ambition to be one
of the very best. So he welcomed every experience
that added to his knowledge.</p>

<p>Even when his work seemed tamest he was
acquiring facts and knowledge with surprising
rapidity; and all that he learned enlarged his
background and was just so much preparation
for the day when he should truly become a great
reporter. One of his assignments was to fly out
to an incoming steamer in a seaplane and bring
ashore some important news photographs from
Europe. It was on this flight that Jimmy had
his first sight of a lightship anchored at sea. He
was instructed to meet the incoming ship near the
Ambrose lightship, off the entrance to the Ambrose
Channel that leads from the deep water of
the sea up to the New York harbor.</p>

<p>Jimmy knew the approximate hour of the
steamship’s arrival at that point. He flew out to
sea a little early, to be certain that he was on
time. He was to get the pictures when the ship
slowed down to pick up the pilot who was to
guide her up the channel to her dock. Arrangements
had been made by wireless with the
photographer, who was aboard the liner. He was
to get the pictures down to Jimmy in the seaplane.</p>

<p>When the latter reached the lightship, the
ocean liner was not yet in sight. Jimmy decided
that he would not fly out to sea to meet her.
He was a little distrustful of all this vast stretch
of water about him. He had been ordered to
meet the ship when she picked up her pilot. The
pilot boat was cruising not far away. Jimmy
decided that he would come down on the water,
which was very calm, and take a look at the lightship.
So he flew close to the vessel, then came
down in a long glide, and was soon bobbing safely
on the gentle swells of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>The lightship was only a few hundred feet distant.
Jimmy turned the nose of his plane toward
the vessel and taxied to a point close to leeward
of it. He had never seen such a curious craft.
It was a clumsy, bunty sort of ship, apparently
not more than a hundred feet long, with bulging,
bulky bow, like that of a Dutch canal-boat. The
sides of the vessel were very high for a ship of
her length. The ship was a straw color; and
painted on her hull in huge letters was the word
<span class='it'>Ambrose</span>. She had two masts, and at the top of
each mast was apparently a guide light, protected
by a circular black iron grating, to flash out
warning signals in the dark.</p>

<p>Jimmy taxied as close to the ship as he dared.
The crew of ten or a dozen men was lined up
along the leeward rail, watching him. Apparently
the men thought he wished to board the
ship, for one of them had a light line in his hand.
Seeing that, Jimmy decided he would go aboard.
He scanned the sea and saw no sign of an approaching
liner. Then he forced his plane a very
little closer to the lightship and waited. At once
the man with the coil of rope drew back his arm
and flung the line straight toward Jimmy. It
sped through the air, uncoiling as it flew, and
dropped lightly on the fuselage of the plane.
Jimmy stepped out on a wing and secured the
line. In another moment he had been drawn
close up to the ship. A port opened. A sailor
skilfully drew one wing up to the side of the
ship, holding it so it would not bump the vessel.
Jimmy walked out on the wing and climbed
aboard the vessel. At once his plane was allowed
to drift a few fathoms to leeward, where it was
safe.</p>

<p>The sailors, eager for news from shore, flocked
around Jimmy. They plied him with questions.
When he had answered all they asked, he put a
few questions himself. He wanted to know
about all the interesting things he saw. The
huge anchor chain and the anchor itself interested
Jimmy. The chain was the thickest chain Jimmy
had ever seen. The links were made of iron two
inches thick, and each link was strengthened by
a cast-iron stud. Jimmy whistled when the captain
told him that a single fathom of the chain
weighed close to 200 pounds, and that the entire
chain, measuring only 120 fathoms, weighed
about twelve tons. Of course, the chain had to
be moved by an engine.</p>

<p>The anchors, too, attracted Jimmy. One of
them was at the bottom of the sea, of course, but
the other was stopped fast at the bow of the vessel,
ready to be let down at a moment’s notice.
It was a mushroom anchor, and got its name
from its shape; for it looked for all the world
like a huge metal toadstool. The circular edge
of the anchor was sharp, so it would bite into the
bottom of the sea easily.</p>

<p>But the thing that interested Jimmie most was
the light. This, the captain said, was an occulting
white light, that was visible for twelve out of
every fifteen seconds. The light at the forward
masthead is always used, excepting when that
light is out of commission. Then the after light
shines.</p>

<p>“If there was a string of lights like this one,
each with a distinctive flash,” said Jimmy, “a
fellow could find his way by night at sea as easily
as he can follow his route on land when he follows
the Air Mail beacons.”</p>

<p>“There is a string of lights all along the coast,”
said the captain, “and each has its distinctive
flash. Most of them are on land, but a few are
floating lights, like this, which mark danger
points far out from shore.”</p>

<p>Jimmy discovered that the great twelve-inch
steam fog-whistle blows for three seconds in each
fifteen, when the fog is bad at this light station,
and the fog bell rings once every thirty seconds.
Once every twelve seconds the submarine bell
strikes two groups of two strokes each. And the
radio fog-signal of the <span class='it'>Ambrose</span> lightship is a
continuous string of dashes, exactly like the
signal of the radio beacons along the lighted airway.
Thus, whether a passing ship’s captain sees
the light or merely hears the fog-horn, or detects
the radio signal, he knows what lightship he is
passing.</p>

<p>Jimmy was so much interested in learning
about the lightship that he could have spent hours
aboard of her, but the captain warned him that
the liner was visible on the horizon. Jimmy
knew it was time for him to be stirring. His
plane was drawn up to the ship and he got carefully
aboard of her. Soon he was in the air. He
came down close to the pilot-boat, which was
ready to put a pilot aboard the approaching
steamer. The men on this boat said they would
get his photographs for him when they put the
pilot aboard the liner.</p>

<p>The big steamer came plowing along, her speed
gradually lessening, until she was practically at a
standstill. Meantime a rowboat had taken the
pilot from the pilot-boat to the side of the liner.
The pilot climbed up the ladder at the side of the
ship and spoke to the photographer who stood at
the rail, ready with his photographs. These were
carefully wrapped for protection. He handed
them to a sailor who slipped down the ladder with
them and put them in the hands of one of the
men in the rowboat. The little craft headed
about and pulled for the pilot-boat. The liner
began to move slowly and presently was steaming
away at a rapid rate.</p>

<p>Jimmy was all ready to board his plane when
the men got back with his pictures. He stowed
them in his coat, climbed carefully aboard his
ship, and floated away to a safe distance. Then
he rose from the water, headed his plane straight
for his landing-place on the southern shore of
Long Island, and went streaking back with his
pictures. He gave them to a waiting messenger
and hustled to get back to his own field.</p>

<p>As he drew near the hangar he noticed great
activity. Mechanics were bustling about, ships
were on the line, ready to take off, and pilots were
getting into their flying togs. Jimmy knew
something was in the air. He was just about to
ask some one what was up when a mechanic who
looked after his ship spied him and shouted:
“Call up your office. You are wanted. There’s
a big story that broke up in Pennsylvania. I’ve
got your ship ready to go at a moment’s notice.
She’s been warming up for half an hour.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:1.0em;'>Jimmy is Tricked by His Rival</p>

<p>In a moment Jimmy was in telephonic
communication with his chief. “There has been
a big coal mine disaster, Jimmy,” said Mr. Johnson.
“We have just received a despatch from
Shenandoah about it. The mine is near that city.
More than one hundred men are believed to have
been imprisoned in the mine. It is not known
how many are dead or whether any of the entombed
miners are still alive. We want as complete
a story of the disaster as you can gather in
a short time, and we particularly want photographs.
You’ve got just about time enough to
get there and get some photographs before dark.
You can pick up your story after you get your
pictures. Then hustle back here. If you make
as good time as you have made on some other
assignments, you can get back here before 10:30.
You ought to make it by 11:00 for sure, and you
<span class='it'>must</span> be here by 11:15. I would send Handley
with you, but he is in Phillipsburg on a story. I
will try to get into touch with him by phone, and
order him to go to Shenandoah, to follow up the
story to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do my best, Mr. Johnson,” said Jimmy.
“Good-bye. I’m off.” And in less than no time
he <span class='it'>was</span> off.</p>

<p>The minute Jimmy had reached a safe altitude
and was straightened out on his course, he began
to consider how he should cover this story. He
had never reported the story of a coal mine disaster.
He was a little uncertain as to how to get
at it.</p>

<p>First of all, there was the matter of topography.
Shenandoah was in the very heart of the
anthracite region in Pennsylvania. That meant
it was right among the hills. Jimmy knew the
region well. It was almost on the Air Mail route.
In fact, in a straight line it was only three miles
from Ringtown. But a great ridge—the North
Mahanoy Mountain, that towered aloft almost
1,900 feet—rose between Ringtown and
Shenandoah. The highway between the two places, circuitous
and winding, was probably twice that distance.
Jimmy was of course sure that he could
make a landing at Ringtown. But whether he
could do so at Shenandoah or not, he did not
know. The town itself occupied almost every
foot of the level land in the little bottom in which
it stood. On every side the ground rose sharply.</p>

<p>Jimmy managed to get the proper topographic
map from his map case. Folding it in small compass
he studied it as he flew along. The only
place where there seemed to be even the possibility
of making a safe landing was in the tiny
bottom along Lost Creek, southwest of the town.
But the more Jimmy studied the map, the more
impossible this place seemed for his purpose.
Jimmy finally decided that he would not take a
chance. He would land at Ringtown, get a
motor car, and drive to Shenandoah.</p>

<p>“If Johnnie Lee is home,” thought Jimmy,
“there won’t be a bit of trouble about that.
Johnnie will take me over there in his car. That
will be just the thing, too. Then he can help me
cover the story. I can tell him what to do and
he can do it readily enough. It will give him a
start toward reporting. Johnnie will know the
country round about, too, and that may be a very
great advantage. For I see now that it is going
to hustle me to get back on time. I’m sure glad
this has turned out this way.”</p>

<p>A load seemed to drop from Jimmy’s mind.
He had come to a decision as to his course. Now
he had only to drive ahead as fast as possible
along the way he had chosen. He felt his confidence
growing.</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard his own name sounding in
his head phones. “The New York <span class='it'>Press</span> speaking
to Jimmy Donnelly,” said the voice. “We
have been in touch with Handley at Phillipsburg.
He will go with you to Shenandoah.
Land at Easton and wait for him. He is on the
watch for you.”</p>

<p>Jimmy hardly knew whether to be pleased or
sorry. He would be glad enough of Handley’s
help. Even the two of them could not clean up
the story in the short time Jimmy would have
at the scene of the disaster. But now that Jimmy
saw an opportunity to help his friend Johnnie
Lee, he rather regretted that Handley was to
join him. They could hardly bother with Johnnie
now.</p>

<p>These thoughts went through Jimmy’s mind in
an instant. They did not prevent him from answering
promptly the <span class='it'>Morning Press</span> message.
He put his mouthpiece to his lips and said:
“Jimmy Donnelly talking to the New York
<span class='it'>Press</span>. I have your message about Handley and
will wait for him at Easton.”</p>

<p>When Jimmy reached that city, it looked for
a little time as though he would not be able to
keep his word. It hardly seemed possible to make
a landing. But west of the city Jimmy found
some fields and got down safety, though he had
a scare when he saw a fence loom up suddenly
before him. His plane struck sand and came to
a stop within ten feet of the fence.</p>

<p>Jimmy hopped out of the ship and looked
about him. Handley was nowhere in sight.
“He’ll have to come along pretty soon if we
are to get the stuff back to New York in time,”
thought Jimmy. “I wonder if there is anything
I could do to help matters.”</p>

<p>He thought of Johnnie Lee. “If I could talk
to him,” muttered Jimmy, “I could put him right
to work.”</p>

<p>With Jimmy, to think was to act. Not far
away was a house. Jimmy raced over to it, and
was rejoiced to see that telephone wires ran to
the house. He knocked at the door. A pleasant
faced woman answered his knock.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon,” said Jimmy, politely. “I
need very much to use a telephone. May I use
yours?”</p>

<p>The woman looked him over. “I take it you
are the pilot of the plane that just landed,” she
said.</p>

<p>“I am,” said Jimmy, “and I am in a trying
situation. It will help me greatly if I may use
your phone.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” she said. “You are welcome.
I’ll be glad if it will help you.”</p>

<p>Jimmy called for the long-distance operator
and asked for the Lee home in Ringtown. He
begged the operator to hurry the call, as it was
an urgent one. In a very few moments Jimmy
had his connection. To his delight, Johnnie
himself answered the telephone. Jimmy recognized
his voice at once.</p>

<p>“Hello, Johnnie,” he said. “This is Jimmy
Donnelly. Have you heard anything about a
mine explosion in your neighborhood?”</p>

<p>“We sure have,” said Johnnie. “It was near
Krebs. It was a terrible affair.”</p>

<p>“Where’s Krebs?” demanded Jimmy.</p>

<p>“About two miles from here. It’s at the foot
of North Mahanoy Mountain.”</p>

<p>“What do you know about the disaster,
Johnnie?”</p>

<p>“A lot, Jimmy. My father’s first cousin, Pat
Healy, telephoned us all about it. He’s a foreman
in the mine, and was just on his way out
when the explosion occurred. He got out all
right, though he was hurt some. But he says
there are scores of men entombed.”</p>

<p>“Can you get hold of him again, Johnnie?”
cried Jimmy, his voice almost shaking with eagerness.</p>

<p>“Sure. He lives near us. Why?”</p>

<p>“It’s like this, Johnnie. I’m on my way out
to cover this story. I’ve got to get pictures and
as much of the story as I can pick up in a little
while. But I had to land in Easton to pick up
Mr. Handley. That’s going to delay me a lot.
This is a chance for you to show what you can
do in collecting news. Will you try it?”</p>

<p>“Will I? You bet your neck I will. What
do you want me to do?”</p>

<p>“Have you got a camera?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have.”</p>

<p>“Then get some pictures of the wrecked mine
if you can, and of the mine entrance, injured
miners, crowds at the shaft, or anything else that
will illustrate the story.”</p>

<p>“I can do that easily. I can drive to the mouth
of the mine in less than ten minutes. I’ll hustle
right over and get all the pictures I can. Anything
else?”</p>

<p>“Sure. Get the story. Get hold of your
father’s cousin again. Find as many survivors
as possible. See anybody you can who is in authority
at the mine and get a statement from him.
Get all the details you can.”</p>

<p>“Just what do you want, Jimmy?”</p>

<p>“Find out what happened, when it happened,
where it happened, how it happened, why it happened,
and to whom it happened. Get every
detail you can about every phase of the story.
Get the names of the dead and injured, if possible.
Find out how many are still in the mine.
Maybe Mr. Healy can tell you. Get a story
of the explosion from him. Find out how it
happened and what caused it. Get Mr. Healy
to tell you about the mine itself—what it is like,
whether there is any chance for rescue, whether
there are places where the imprisoned men can
take refuge in the mine. Ask all the questions
you can think of. Try to get enough stuff together
so you can tell me a complete story of the
disaster when I get there.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it, Jimmy. I’m off this minute.
Good-bye.”</p>

<p>Jimmy said good-bye and rang off. “That
was a lucky thought,” he muttered, “to set Johnnie
to work. He’s evidently got the inside track.
He may be able to get the whole story.”</p>

<p>Jimmy ascertained the amount of his tolls and
paid the woman. She had heard his talk with
Johnnie and was intensely interested. She asked
Jimmy question after question about his work
as a flying reporter. Before Jimmy knew it, half
an hour had passed. Then he noticed a clock and
frowned. He looked out at his plane. Some
small boys had gathered about it, but there was
no sign of Handley. Fifteen minutes more
passed, and Jimmy was growing desperate. Finally
he reached for the telephone again. “Please
get me the New York <span class='it'>Morning Press</span>” he told
the operator.</p>

<p>When Jimmy finally got his connection, he
called for Mr. Johnson. “Have you any idea
how long it is going to take Handley to reach me
here at Easton?” he asked. “I’ve waited for
him more than an hour already. I’ve got to push
on if I am to get any photographs.”</p>

<p>“What’s this about Handley and Easton and
waiting an hour? What are you talking about?”
demanded the managing editor.</p>

<p>“What am I talking about!” exclaimed
Jimmy. “I am talking about Handley. You
ordered me to wait for him in Easton. I’ve been
here at Easton for more than an hour. Can you
give me any idea how soon he will arrive? I can’t
possibly wait much longer if I am to get back
with the story in time for the midnight edition.”</p>

<p>“You’re in Easton! Waiting for Handley!
What are you talking about? I never ordered
you to stop at Easton. You ought to be in Shenandoah
this very minute.”</p>

<p>“You never ordered me to stop at Easton!”
cried Jimmy. “Somebody did. I received a
radio message forty minutes after I took off, telling
me you had ordered Handley to join me here
and ordering me to wait for him. I acknowledged
the message and supposed you had my acknowledgment.”</p>

<p>“Somebody has put one over on you, Jimmy,”
said the managing editor. “It’s a pretty bad
business. But we have no time to discuss it now.
Get on to Shenandoah as fast as you can and
do the best you can. I want to see you about this
as soon as you get back here. Now hustle.”</p>

<p>Jimmy was mortified, angry, and anxious. His
face showed his anxiety. He paid his telephone
tolls and raced back to his plane. As fast as he
could, he got his ship into the air. Then he
opened his throttle as far as it would open and
went streaking along the Air Mail route for
Ringtown.</p>

<p>In less than half an hour he dropped down on
the landing field at that place. He leaped from
his plane, threw off his flying togs, and raced for
Johnnie Lee’s house. Johnnie’s mother met him
at the door.</p>

<p>“Johnnie’s expecting you,” she said. “He
called up a few minutes ago and said you should
call him at Healy’s when you arrived. Come in.
I’ll get the connection for you.” And in no time
she had it. She asked for Johnnie and handed
the receiver to Jimmy.</p>

<p>“Hello, Johnnie,” he said. “This is Jimmy.
I just arrived at your house. Where are you?
How can I get into touch with you?”</p>

<p>“I’m at Healy’s. It’s straight down the road.
Mother will show you the way. Come over as
quick as you can. Mr. Healy is talking to me
now.”</p>

<p>Jimmy hung up the receiver, got directions
from Mrs. Lee, and raced down the road. In ten
minutes he was in the Healy home.</p>

<p>“What have you done and what have you
learned?” Jimmy demanded, after Johnnie had
introduced him to Mr. Healy.</p>

<p>“I went right over to the mine with my camera,
after you called me, and I have a whole roll
of films for you—a dozen pictures. They ought
to be good, for the conditions were just right for
taking them. I got a picture of the mine mouth,
the crowd about it, some snaps of the rescue crews
descending into the mine, one of an injured miner
who was hurt in the attempt at rescue, and other
similar pictures.”</p>

<p>“Good! They are just what I want. What
about the story?”</p>

<p>“I believe I have the whole thing. Mr. Healy
was in the mine when the explosion occurred. In
fact, he was close to the very spot where it happened.
He saw the explosion occur. He was
injured slightly, but not disabled. He gathered
together all the men within call and started for
an old opening that is no longer used. The explosion
had prevented escape through the shaft
used nowadays. Gases began to spread through
the mine, and the men with Mr. Healy were overcome
one by one. Those still able to walk tried
to drag the others out. But the only man who
got out on his own feet was my cousin. He
dragged out one man. Then he collapsed himself.
He came to in about half an hour and
managed to stagger home. He telephoned about
the man he had dragged out, and some miners
came and got him. We heard about it over the
telephone, just before you called me from
Easton.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you repeat your story to me, Mr.
Healy?” asked Jimmy. “Just start at the beginning.
Tell me what the conditions were like
in the mine when the explosion came. That is,
about how many men you think went into the
mine, how many were still in it, and what the
mine is like. Give me a mental picture of it, so
I can follow your story. Then start again with
the explosion and tell me what you saw and did.”
For half an hour Mr. Healy talked steadily,
stopping only when he was interrupted by Jimmy
with a question. He gave Jimmy an excellent
picture of the mine workings. Mr. Healy had
been a foreman in this particular mine for years,
and knew every foot of it as workers above
ground know the cities in which they live. Then
he told of the explosion, pictured the damage it
did, showed how it shut off escape by the newer
shaft, and pictured the situation of the imprisoned
men. He estimated their number at more
than one hundred.</p>

<p>“If the gas was as severe in other chambers
as it was where we were,” he said, “most of those
one hundred men are now dead. I have been
using the telephone, and so far as I can learn,
we two men who got out through the old drift
are the only men who have escaped. Unless some
of the miners were able to retreat to dead ends of
passages, ahead of the gas, and make air-tight
barricades to keep the gas out, I fear every man
in the mine is past help. But we shall not know
for sure until the rescue crews have searched
every foot of the workings. That will take many
hours, and perhaps some days.”</p>

<p>Jimmy checked back over his notes. His story
seemed to be very complete. He asked for a few
more details about this point or that. Then he
thrust his notes into his pocket. “You have given
me a very complete account, Mr. Healy,” he said.
“I can write a mighty clear story just from these
notes. But I must see the mine myself, and the
mine mouth, and the crowds, and if possible I
must talk with some of the officials. You don’t
feel well enough to go over there with me, do
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am all right now,” said Mr. Healy.
“I’ll be glad to go with you.”</p>

<p>They hurried out to Johnnie’s car and were
rushed over to the mouth of the mine, which was
hardly more than a mile distant. Parking the
car, the three walked about through the crowd,
observing, asking questions, gathering up what
incidents they could.</p>

<p>“There’s the superintendent,” said Mr. Healy,
as a large man came out of one of the mine buildings.
“Would you like to talk to him?”</p>

<p>“I surely would,” answered Jimmy.</p>

<p>“Then come on.”</p>

<p>They walked toward the man. While they
were still at some distance from him, they saw a
young man hurry up to him and lay a detaining
hand on his arm. The superintendent looked surprised.
The young man said something. The
superintendent brushed him roughly aside and
went on. He seemed angry. He was still frowning
when he came face to face with Mr. Healy
and the two lads.</p>

<p>“Pat, I’m mighty glad to see you,” said the
superintendent, “but I am mighty sad to see
you alone. I fear it’s all up with the men underground.”</p>

<p>“This young man wants to talk to you,” said
Mr. Healy. “He’s a reporter from New York.”</p>

<p>“So was that jackass that just tried to stop
me,” said the superintendent. “I don’t want to
talk to reporters.”</p>

<p>“But this lad is a very good friend of mine,”
urged Mr. Healy. “And he is a gentleman. I
know you will be willing to talk to him.”</p>

<p>“Well, what is it?” said the superintendent.
“I haven’t much time to spare. This is a
crowded hour for me.”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much,” said Jimmy. “I
know how you feel. I don’t blame you for not
wanting to talk about this terrible affair. I appreciate
your courtesy.” Then Jimmy began to
ask questions, in a courteous, considerate
manner. The mine official gave him all the information
he asked for.</p>

<p>When the interview was ended, the superintendent
walked on. So did the Healy party.</p>

<p>Presently Jimmy heard a voice saying: “There
he is. He’s the only man who escaped unaided.
He dragged out another man, and they are the
only men who have reached the surface so far.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get a statement from him,” replied another
voice.</p>

<p>Jimmy knew this latter voice well—too well.
He began to tremble with anger. A sudden light
shone in upon him. Now he understood the game
that had been played upon him. Now he knew
who had tricked him into landing at Easton. The
voice he was listening to was the voice of Rand.</p>

<p>Like a shot Jimmy turned to Johnnie. “If
you think anything of me, Johnnie,” he said,
“don’t let your cousin talk to the fellow who is
coming to interview him. It’s Rand, the fellow
I have told you about. It was Rand who stopped
the superintendent a little while ago, though at
a distance I did not recognize him. But I know
well enough now who it was.”</p>

<p>Johnnie laid his hand on Mr. Healy’s arm.
“Pat,” he said, “this fellow who is approaching
to talk to you is Jimmy’s worst enemy. He has
just played a dirty trick on him. Don’t say a
word to him.”</p>

<p>“Played a dirty trick on Jimmy, did he? Very
well. He gets no news from me.”</p>

<p>A moment later Rand stepped up and began
to question the mine foreman. “I have nothing
to say. See the superintendent,” snapped Mr.
Healy. And turning on his heel, he strode away,
with Johnnie and Jimmy at his heels.</p>

<p>But as Jimmy walked away, he said: “Rand,
dirty tricks don’t pay. You thought you had
put over a clever one when you got me down at
Easton to-day, but your game failed. This is
what came of it. You lose out yourself.” And
Jimmy hurried after Mr. Healy and Johnnie,
while Rand stood and cursed him. “I’ll get you
yet,” Jimmy heard him say. But Jimmy wasn’t
caring about Rand’s threats. He held all the aces
in the pack himself.</p>

<p>When Jimmy had finished writing his
story, after a fast trip back to his office,
where he arrived well ahead of his deadline, he
reported to the managing editor.</p>

<p>“Well, I see you got here in time anyway,
Jimmy,” smiled that official. “Your photographs
are fine, but they are a little small. Why
didn’t you use your regular news camera?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t take the pictures, Mr. Johnson.
Johnnie Lee took them. He had to use his own
camera because I was miles away, at Easton. He
got the story, too, and he got the details in fine
shape. If it hadn’t been for Johnnie, I guess I’d
still be at the mine.”</p>

<p>“This sounds interesting. How did your
young friend get into the affair, anyway? Tell
me about it.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t much to tell, Mr. Johnson. When
I landed at Easton, and didn’t see Handley anywhere,
I suspected I might have to wait some
time for him, so I called Johnnie up at his home.
By good luck he was right at hand. He lives
within two miles of the wrecked mine. I asked
him to see what he could do for me. He skipped
right over in his car, got the photographs,
rounded up the only man who escaped from the
mine on his own feet, and had the whole story in
hand when I reached there. He introduced me
to this survivor, who is a foreman in the mine,
and so was able to give us such a comprehensive
description of the place. Then Johnnie took us
both back to the mine, so I could see the place and
the crowds for myself. The foreman got me an
interview with the mine superintendent. And by
the way, the superintendent had just refused to
talk to Rand.”</p>

<p>“Rand, eh? So he’s working on this story.”
The managing editor’s eyes narrowed to mere
slits. He looked at Jimmy intently. “You
don’t suppose, Jimmy, that Rand——”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I <span class='it'>do</span> suppose so,” interrupted
Jimmy. “I’d be willing to bet my last nickel
that it was Rand who tricked me into landing at
Easton. You know the paper he works for has
a plane at the same field where we keep ours. I
didn’t see Rand at the field before I took off, but
I believe he was there. And I believe that in
some way he got wind of the fact that you had
ordered me to Shenandoah. I have no proof of
that, and I don’t see how I can get proof. He
might easily have picked up the fact from employees
about the field. My mechanic knew that
you wanted me to make the trip. He told me so
the instant I got in from my flight out to sea.
He might have mentioned the matter to other
people about the field. Of course everybody soon
knew about the disaster, and it was a safe bet that
I would have to fly to the scene. Rand would
know that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, or some one may have tapped our wire.
Or some one may be paying mechanics at the field
to keep tabs on you. I know of at least one newspaper
in this town that wouldn’t be above such
work. You just watch yourself, Jimmy. Keep
your eyes and ears open and see if you can’t find
out more about this matter. Everything turned
out well this time, but you won’t always have a
Johnnie Lee on the spot to pull you out of a
hole.”</p>

<p>“That’s what he did, Mr. Johnson. Johnnie
pulled me out of a great big hole. I might have
rounded up the story after I got there, but I
could not possibly have gotten the pictures also.
It grew dark soon after I reached the mine.
Johnnie made a fine job of it. I believe you will
say so, too, when you read his story.”</p>

<p>Just then a copy boy thrust some proofs into
Mr. Johnson’s hands.</p>

<p>“Here it is,” said the managing editor. “Now
we’ll see what your story is like.”</p>

<p>“It’s really Johnnie’s story, Mr. Johnson,”
protested Jimmy. “Please read it and see if you
don’t think Johnnie has shown enough ability
now to start in as a cub.”</p>

<p>Mr. Johnson smiled. “What a fine world it
would be, Jimmy,” he said, “if we all had such
loyal friends as Johnnie Lee has in you.”</p>

<p>Then he began to read, and the expression on
his face showed well enough that he was
interested. When he had finished, he laid down the
proofs. “It’s a good story, Jimmy,” he said.
“Then does Johnnie get his job?” demanded
Jimmy.</p>

<p>“You are nothing if not an ardent partisan,
Jimmy. I hadn’t any idea of employing Johnnie;
but he has been so useful to us that if he
wants to come on here and start in as a cub, at
the lowest salary we pay cubs, we’ll give him a
chance. I somehow have a feeling that he has
good stuff in him.”</p>

<p>“Indeed he has, Mr. Johnson. You’ll never
be sorry you hired him. When do you want him
to report for work?”</p>

<p>“There’s no hurry, Jimmy. I’ll drop him a
line in a few days. I want him to understand
exactly the terms on which he comes and the
amount of pay he will receive while he is learning
his job.”</p>

<p>“Thank you ever so much, Mr. Johnson. I’ll
do all I can to help him make good.” And Jimmy
walked out of the managing editor’s office as
happy as a lark. Altogether, it had been a mighty
good day for Jimmy.</p>

<p>“It’s an ill wind that blows nobody good,” he
thought. “If Rand hadn’t pulled me down at
Easton, Johnnie would never have gotten this
job. It just seems to me as though most of the
things that look like difficulties when they occur
are really opportunities. It’s been that way with
me more than once. The main thing is to keep
a stiff upper lip, use your head, and just keep
on going. I’ll try to remember that the next
time I get in a pinch.”</p>

<p>Jimmy went back to his ship, to see that she
was put in shape for instant use again. He was
very happy. Not only had he made good again
for himself, but he had helped his old friend. He
had secured for him the opening that Johnnie
so much desired. He wanted to write to Johnnie
and tell him about the situation, but he decided
not to do it. “Mr. Johnson evidently prefers to
write to him himself,” thought Jimmy. “I don’t
want to do anything that could possibly gum
things up.” So he restrained himself.</p>

<p>It wasn’t long, however, before Jimmy had
abundant opportunity to tell Johnnie all about
the matter. A new and important airport was
to be opened in central Pennsylvania. Celebrated
fliers by the dozens were to be on hand. An attractive
program of races and flying stunts had
been arranged, and the affair had been given
great publicity. Mr. Johnson decided to send a
man to cover the story. Quite naturally, he
selected Jimmy.</p>

<p>“Go up there and get us a good story,
Jimmy,” he said. “If all the fliers are present
who are advertised to be there, this will be a very
interesting gathering. And by the way, I suppose
you will fly out along the Air Mail route.
If you do, stop at Ringtown and take Johnnie
Lee along with you. I wrote him two days ago,
offering him a job, and I just received his reply.
He is eager to come. Pick him up and take him
to the airport opening with you. I’ll give you
credentials for him. He can start right in with
you. And remember, I expect you to help him
learn his job.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Johnson,” replied Jimmy.
“I’ll do my very best to help Johnnie. You
won’t be sorry you hired him. I’ll pick him up as
I fly out, and bring him back to the city with me.”</p>

<p>“That’s exactly what I wish,” replied the managing
editor.</p>

<p>So it happened that when Jimmy flew to the
air races, he stopped at Ringtown and picked up
his old friend. Then the two flew on to the
airport.</p>

<p>The aviation meeting was all it had been advertised
to be. Scores of pilots were present, many
of them famous veterans of the air. The edge
of the flying field was lined for hundreds of yards
with ships that were crowded so close together
their wing tips almost touched. There were flying
machines of almost every known variety.
Tiny Moth planes stood wing to wing with huge
tri-motored cabin ships that would hold a dozen
passengers each. There were monoplanes and
biplanes, and even some gliders were to be seen.
The Army and the Navy were represented by
several fliers each. The planes of the latter instantly
caught the eye as they stood on the line
in military formation, noticeable among all other
planes for their blazing insignia on their wing
surfaces. It was a sight to delight a pilot’s heart.</p>

<p>Yet the ground show was nothing compared
to the exhibition in the air. Aloft there was a
constant stream of ships. Some were arriving,
some departing, some were carrying passengers
at so much a ride, some were stunting, and
others were merely aloft for the pleasure of
it. Then came races. The air was cleared of all
other fliers, and the speedsters had their innings.
Back and forth they darted along a course many
miles long, one end of which was in the centre of
the new airport. Around the striped pylon they
roared, some darting upward on the turn, others
roaring around on level keel. And so steeply were
the ships banked that each seemed fairly to be
standing on one wing as it whirled around the
pylon. It was a stirring sight.</p>

<p>But the performance that stopped every heart
and made every onlooker hold his breath was the
parachute jumps. Jimmy and Johnnie had gone
aloft again by the time the jumping started.
Ever since Jimmy had received the piece of Warren
Long’s parachute, he had felt a particular interest
in parachute jumps. He believed he could
see the jumps better if he were in the air, about
on the level with the jumpers, than he could see
them if he were on the ground. Likewise, he
wanted to get some photographs of the jumpers,
taken from aloft. So he and Johnnie had gone
aloft once more.</p>

<p>They flew along lazily, to the rear of the ship
that held the jumpers. And they were a little
lower than this ship. Jimmy wanted to see just
how the parachutes worked. He had selected an
excellent viewpoint; for when the first jumper
walked out on a wing of the ship and calmly
dropped toward the earth, Jimmy could see his
every movement. Down dropped the man,
straight as a plummet, hardly moving his body or
limbs, until he was well below the plane. Then
Jimmy saw him reach for the rip-cord, grasp the
metal ring, and give it a sharp jerk. With an
instant response the covers of the parachute pack
snapped open, the folds of the white silk “umbrella”
were caught by the wind, ballooning out
and opening full with a crack that could be heard
all over the huge airport. The downward flight
of the jumper was checked. With a jerk he spun
upright, then settled toward the earth under his
wide-spreading canopy. He landed safely, amid
great applause. Johnnie got several fine snaps
with the camera while the jump was taking place.</p>

<p>Another jumper followed. This one elected
to come down awhirling. He stepped off backward,
and went spinning toward the earth like a
ball. When he pulled his rip-cord, his parachute
pulled him upright with a jerk that, as Jimmy
phrased it, must have splashed his liver against
his backbone like a butcher throwing a slab of
beef on the block. But the jumper landed safe
and sound and appeared none the worse for his
experience.</p>

<p>The best performance—at least the one that
most attracted the crowd—had been reserved for
the last. A woman was to do some stunts and then
put on a parachute and jump. She was a slender
young flier, whom the <span class='it'>Morning Press</span> men had
noticed at the hangar. She was clad in a light
flying suit, and her short hair was bound tight
with a broad red ribbon wound about her brow.</p>

<p>When she came out on the wing of the plane,
preparatory to giving her exhibition, Jimmy
could feel his pulse quicken perceptibly. The
sight of men about to risk their lives had not
stirred him so much. They were fliers, like himself,
and every pilot expected that some day he
might have to make the trip to the ground in a
parachute. But to see a young woman risking
her life, merely to make a show for a curious
multitude, stirred Jimmy as it did others. He
knew well enough that the crowd on the ground
was standing in breathless suspense. He flew his
plane as near to the jumper’s ship as he dared, so
Johnnie could get some close-up snapshots.</p>

<p>Jimmy watched the woman like a hawk. He
noticed her every movement. She made her way
along the wing of the plane. A rope ladder had
been fastened to a strut. This the woman untied
and lowered. Then she swung over the edge of
the wing and made her way down the rope ladder.
She had no parachute. Should she lose her grip
or be jolted from the ladder she would fall
straight to earth and be crushed. Jimmy almost
shuddered as he looked at her. It seemed terrible
to him that any one should risk life in this way.
He could hardly bear to watch her. Yet he had
come aloft to see the performance and he steeled
himself to watch. He kept his plane moving at
the same rate as the exhibition ship but at a lower
level.</p>

<p>Down the rope ladder came the young woman.
This swung and swayed uncertainly in the breeze.
At the bottom of the ladder was a strong metal
rung or crossbar. It helped to keep the ladder
from blowing backward too far. When the performer
came to this metal bar she did not pause
but grasped it with both hands and lowered her
body into space. There she dangled, a thousand
feet in air, with nothing between her and an awful
death but her own good grip. Jimmy could feel
chills of horror running up and down his spine.
He prayed that the air would stay calm. He
could hardly bear to look at the woman when she
released one hand from the bar and swung for
a moment by a single arm. It was too much for
Jimmy. He looked away.</p>

<p>When he brought his glance back to the woman
she had altered her position. Now she was hanging
by her knees, her head down, as the ship flew
along. For several minutes she did acrobatic
stunts at the end of the swaying ladder. And
during all that time Jimmy was in a tremble.
But the young woman was as steady as Gibraltar.
She lost neither her nerve nor her grip. Presently
she climbed back up the ladder, rolled and
fastened it to the strut, and then climbed to the
upper wing, where she braced herself and stood
upright with nothing whatever to hold to, while
the ship shot through the air at seventy miles an
hour.</p>

<p>Again Jimmy was in a fever of fear. If she
slipped, if the plane plunged and threw her off
her balance, if the air grew bumpy and tumbled
the ship about, there could be but one end to the
exhibition. The young woman would be thrown
off her balance and blown out into space. Once
more Jimmy turned his look away. He could
not bear to look at her.</p>

<p>When he glanced again at the ship he was following
he saw something that electrified him, that
shocked him into instant activity. From the
crankcase of the ship ahead of him flames were
leaping.</p>

<p>Quick as thought Jimmy turned to his companion.
“Get the tie rope,” he shouted, indicating
with a sweep of his arm where he kept the
rope with which he tied his plane down when he
had to leave it out over night.</p>

<p>Johnnie had the long, strong rope out in no
time. He knotted one end of it fast in the cabin,
so it could not get away from him. Meantime
Jimmy opened his throttle and his ship darted
upward and to one side. In a moment it was
almost wing and wing with the exhibition ship.</p>

<p>The other pilot glanced out and saw Jimmy’s
plane. Johnnie leaned from a cabin window and
began making vigorous gestures. He pointed to
the woman on the upper wing of the exhibition
plane. She was utterly unconscious that anything
was wrong. Then Johnnie held up his rope
and made a gesture to indicate that he would try
to pick up the woman on the plane wing. For a
moment the pilot looked at Johnnie as though he
did not comprehend. It came to Johnnie that the
pilot did not yet know his ship was afire. The
flames were underneath the engine, and he had
not yet noticed them. Violently Johnnie gestured
toward the crankcase. The pilot got partly
to his feet and peered over the edge of his plane.
Instantly he saw what was wrong. Johnnie once
more held up his rope and pointed to the woman
on the upper wing. The pilot nodded agreement.</p>

<p>“He understands,” shouted Johnnie.</p>

<p>With a suddenness that almost threw Johnnie
off his feet, Jimmy banked his plane and circled.
In a moment he was once more to the rear of the
exhibition plane, but now he was above it. The
ship was flying slowly, on level keel. Very carefully,
like a refueling plane about to fuel another
ship, Jimmy flew his craft over and a trifle ahead
of the other plane. Johnnie was watching carefully.</p>

<p>“There!” he shouted. “You’re just right.
Slow her up a bit.”</p>

<p>Jimmy followed instructions. In a moment he
was keeping pace with the other ship, but was
slightly in advance of it. Johnnie leaned through
the open window and started to lower the rope.
The wind blew it almost straight back. He drew
the rope in and fastened the starter handle to it
with a loose knot. Then he leaned from the window
once more and carefully but swiftly lowered
the rope.</p>

<p>Meantime the young woman on the wing below
him had been watching with curious interest. She
did not understand what was afoot. It was well
she did not. She might have lost her nerve. She
caught the rope as it came level with her and held
it uncertainly, meantime looking up at Johnnie
questioningly. Johnnie saw that she did not comprehend
the situation. He pointed toward the
blazing crankcase. The girl held fast to his rope
and took a step toward the leading edge of the
plane wing. The moment she saw the flames she
shrank back in evident terror, and Johnnie’s heart
almost stood still with fear lest she fall from the
plane wing. But she recovered her nerve in an
instant. Grasping the starter handle, she quickly
untied it and laid it down on the wing. That one
act told Johnnie that she had a complete grip on
herself. Otherwise she might thoughtlessly have
tossed it into the air. In a second the girl had the
rope around her body, just below her arms. She
tied it tight, with knot after knot. Then she
looked up and nodded.</p>

<p>Johnnie braced himself and began to haul on
the rope. A foot at a time he dragged the girl
upward, while she clung with both hands to the
life line. It was fortunate she was light in weight.
Johnnie was working at a disadvantage. He
could not get all his muscles into play. Yet
slowly he lifted the girl upward until she could
grasp the window-frame. Then Johnnie threw
open the cabin door, which was immediately beside
the window, and reached out and grasped the
girl. At the same time she slid her foot within
the cabin of the plane and pulled herself, with
Johnnie’s help, after it. Even above the roar
of both motors Johnnie could hear the tremendous
cheer that came up from the ground. Johnnie
slammed the door shut and fastened it. Then
he turned to the girl. She had slumped to the
floor, as pale as death. But it was merely the
reaction after her moment of peril.</p>

<p>Meantime, Jimmy opened his throttle, pulled
back on his stick, and shot his plane upward for
hundreds of feet. By the time he leveled off, the
pilot below him, who had seen a part of the rescue,
had acted to save his own life. The fire had
spread rapidly. Flames were beginning to shoot
into the cockpit. Adjusting the stabilizer of his
ship so that she was slightly nose heavy, the pilot
headed his plane toward a near-by woods. Then
he stepped over the side, and a moment later was
floating safely downward under his open parachute.
He landed near the flying field, without a
scratch.</p>

<p>Seeing the pilot safe and the air clear, for the
burning plane soon crashed in the woods, Jimmy
swooped down and landed in the middle of the
flying field. His plane rolled rapidly toward the
judge’s stand and he taxied it close to the railing
that kept the crowd from the field. A doctor and
several officials rushed out to the ship to look
after the young woman. She was still in a state
of collapse. Carefully they assisted her to the
hangar and gave her the necessary attention.</p>

<p>Jimmy was glad enough to have her off his
hands. He was waiting for his engine to cool a
bit before cutting the switch. Then he intended
to hurry to the telegraph station and send off a
wire. His whole attention was now centered on
the story he must send.</p>

<p>What was his astonishment, then, when the
crowd broke through the barriers and a veritable
mob came charging toward him as he stepped
from his ship. For a second Jimmy was dumbfounded.
He did not understand what was happening.
But it did not take him very long to
learn. As he and Johnnie stepped clear of the
ship the crowd thundered up. A hundred hands
were thrust out at them. A babel of voices arose
in shouted greetings. Men and women swarmed
about them, patting them on their backs, slapping
their shoulders, and reaching for their hands.
Then somebody caught them both from behind,
eager hands lifted them bodily, and in another
moment they were riding from the field on the
shoulders of sturdy men, while the crowd yelled
itself hoarse.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>CHAPTER XIII</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:1.0em;'>Jimmy Has an Adventure with a Bootlegger</p>

<p>It was nearly ten o’clock that night when the
two young fliers walked into the <span class='it'>Morning
Press</span> office in New York, tired but happy.
Jimmy had filed his story as soon as he could get
away from the crowd and write it. A hasty bite
to eat had followed, and then the two young reporters
had hopped off for Long Island, which
they reached quickly and without incident. Now
Jimmy was waiting to see the managing editor.</p>

<p>He did not have to wait long. Mr. Johnson
soon sent for him. Jimmy took Johnnie with
him, and the two stepped into the managing editor’s
office.</p>

<p>“Well, Jimmy, I’m glad to see you back safe
and sound,” said Mr. Johnson. “Sit down and
tell me about your trip. I have about come to the
conclusion that any time news is scarce hereafter
I shall send you out on an assignment. You seem
to have more adventures than any reporter I ever
heard of. When I hired you, it was to <span class='it'>get</span> the
news. I never dreamed that you would also <span class='it'>provide</span>
the news. As I recall it, I paid you a certain
sum to act as pilot, and I had to increase your pay
considerably when you blossomed out into a reporter
as well as a pilot. Now I suppose you’ll
be asking for still more money because you <span class='it'>make</span>
the news as well as report it.”</p>

<p>Jimmy laughed with the managing editor, who
was evidently feeling well pleased. “I’ll be glad
to tell you about my trip, Mr. Johnson,” he said,
“but first I want to introduce my friend Johnnie
Lee. He’s your new reporter and he helped to
make the news to-day.”</p>

<p>“Johnnie, I’m glad to know you,” said Mr.
Johnson, shaking the lad’s hand warmly. “You
certainly made a fine start with the <span class='it'>Press</span>. It
was my idea that you were to come here as a cub,
and start at the very bottom of the ladder. But
it looks as though you have been learning some
tricks from Jimmy. I suppose you’ll want a raise
right away.” And the managing editor laughed
heartily.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said Johnnie. “I don’t want anything
more just now than a chance and enough to
live on.” Then he added, “But I’ll try to deserve
the raise before very long.”</p>

<p>“You had better borrow a rabbit’s foot from
Jimmy,” chuckled Mr. Johnson. “He carries
them in every pocket. He has—excuse me, until
I look at these.”</p>

<p>A copy boy had just brought him proofs of
Jimmy’s photographs.</p>

<p>“Jimmy,” said the managing editor, after
looking at the proofs, “just what breed of rabbit
is it that you get your rabbit feet from? You
have the greatest luck of any fellow I ever knew.
You’ve got the most remarkable picture here
that’s been taken since—since—well, since Clint
Murphy snapped Forest O’Brine working on the
engine of the endurance plane, the <span class='it'>St. Louis
Robin</span>, 3,000 feet above the ground. That picture
was a wonder. But you’ve got one here to
equal it. It’s a close-up snap of that woman
parachute jumper dangling from her plane.”</p>

<p>“I’m mighty glad it came out good,” said
Jimmy, “but I didn’t take it. Johnnie snapped
all the photos while I flew the ship. It’s his picture,
Mr. Johnson.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter who snapped the camera,”
said the managing editor. “It took two of you
to get it. We’ll surely beat the town on this.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we shall,” replied Jimmy. “There
wasn’t another plane in the air when she was
performing except our two ships. Nobody else
could have gotten a close-up of the thing.”</p>

<p>“I’d just like to know, Jimmy,” grinned the
managing editor, “exactly what breed of rabbit
you cultivate. You take a tip from me, Johnnie,
and get some feet from this same breed. Now
you boys run along. I’ve got to get to work.”</p>

<p>Jimmy introduced his friend to Mr. Davis, the
city editor, who would henceforth be Johnnie’s
boss. Then he made Johnnie known to several
of the reporters. Finally the two young men left
the office and went to Jimmy’s boarding house,
for they had decided that they would room together.
In a little while they were both asleep,
but at intervals through the night Jimmy
dreamed about the accident to the parachute
jumper that he had witnessed.</p>

<p>He saw little of Johnnie thereafter, for their
hours did not synchronize. Most of the time
Jimmy’s work was done in daylight hours,
whereas Johnnie went to work early in the afternoon
and worked until late at night. But they
roomed together, sleeping in separate beds, and
left notes for each other, and could of course see
each other when occasion demanded.</p>

<p>The days passed quickly. Johnnie learned
rapidly. Jimmy had few assignments of an exciting
nature. His luck seemed to have deserted
him. He carried pictures, transported reporters,
covered a few unimportant stories. Time hung
heavy on his hands. Meantime the autumn
passed and winter came. It came with a rush and
it came early. Almost over night the balmy days
of Indian summer changed into days of fierce
winds and icy chill. From all parts of the
country came reports of intense cold. Almost in
a twinkling navigation in the north was tied up.
The lakes and streams were frostbound and
frozen. Steamers were caught in the ice, far
from land. Suffering was intense. Deaths were
reported in many quarters, due to the cold.
Isolated lighthouse keepers and the dwellers on
remote islands were cut off from communication.
In many of these isolated places food and medicine
ran low. The weather itself, with the attendant
difficulties of travel, the deaths, the hardships,
all consequent upon the intense cold and
the deep snow and ice, became a leading story.</p>

<p>Day after day, belated tales of freezing, hardship,
death, heroic rescues, blizzards, storms, and
other phases of the weather, or stories incident to
the abnormal cold, came trickling belatedly into
the office. The managing editor watched this
news with growing interest. He had lived, in his
younger days, on the very northern border of the
country and even in Canada. He knew what
these periods of cold and storm meant to the
people living in isolated places. And so, when
one day there came a belated despatch to the
<span class='it'>Press</span>, saying that a feeble wireless message had
been received by a boy wireless operator in
Smithville, in northern New York, telling of the
plight of people on a neighboring island, in Lake
Ontario, the managing editor was filled with both
interest and sympathy. The island was absolutely
cut off from communication with the mainland
by the terrible ice, food was running low,
and a whole family was dying of pneumonia because
of the lack of certain medicines.</p>

<p>“It’s really a story for the Montreal or
Rochester papers to cover,” thought Mr. Johnson,
“but up to this time they haven’t done it.
If we could slip in there ahead of them, we’d not
only do some real good, but we’d bring a lot of
credit to the <span class='it'>Morning Press</span>. I believe I’ll see
how it looks to Donnelly.”</p>

<p>He called Jimmy on the telephone and told
him about the situation. “Do you think you
could reach the place safely with your plane?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Let me look at my maps before I answer
you,” said Jimmy.</p>

<p>Jimmy studied them a moment. “If I flew to
Smithville, which is only six or seven miles south
of Sackett’s Harbor,” he said, “and hopped off
from there, I should not have to fly over more
than a few miles of water. There are several
islands in a straight line close to Smithville. In
case of a forced landing, I could probably make
one of those islands. I think I can do it all
right, and I’ll be glad to go. It won’t take so
very long to make it, either.”</p>

<p>“Then get your ship ready at once. I will
have a physician make up a package of medicines
and write down some directions to be followed in
caring for patients with pneumonia. You take
the stuff out to the island and find out how many
are ill and how ill they are. Leave the drugs and
the directions. Fly back to Smithville and communicate
with me from there. Then we can determine
what should be done further. Perhaps
you will have to take a physician to the island.
We’ll do all we can to help these poor people on
the island.”</p>

<p>When all was ready, and Jimmy had his medicines
aboard, he hopped off and headed straight
for the Hudson, up which river he flew as far as
Albany, where he swung to the left and followed
the Mohawk River to Rome. Thence he followed
the railway tracks direct to Smithville, where he
landed in a great snow-covered field. He had
had his plane equipped with skis, and the snow
did not bother him at all.</p>

<p>Jimmy climbed out of his plane and walked
into the village to ask some questions. He
wanted to know about the possibility of making
a safe landing at the island, whether or not he
had selected the safest route, and what was
known in Smithville concerning the condition of
the people on the island. He found the lad who
had heard the wireless message, and he got information
on all these points. He was soon
satisfied that the islanders needed help, and that
he had chosen the very best way to get there.
The villagers told him he had estimated the distance
correctly and would have to cross only a
few miles of the lake. But there was little open
water, they said, and the chances were that in
case of a forced landing he could get down safely
on the ice, which was very thick, and also rough.
Jimmy said he had a radio sending set and asked
some of the radio fans to listen in for him during
the next half hour. Then he prepared to hop off.</p>

<p>To his surprise, another plane soared into the
sky from a point near the lake shore on the other
side of the village, just as Jimmy was about
ready to take off. He looked at the plane with
dismay. Another newspaper was going to beat
him, he thought, and beat him by the tiniest of
margins. But when he suggested as much to the
townsfolk who had gathered about his plane, they
laughed. Also they winked their eyes.</p>

<p>“Never mind about him,” they said. “The
only medicine he carries is for snakebites. He
flies back and forth between Canada and points
along the shore hereabout. Just what he carries
we don’t know for sure, but we can all guess.
He’ll go right on over to Canada.”</p>

<p>Relieved, Jimmy hopped off, headed straight
out over the frozen lake toward the first island,
and opened his throttle. He did not like the
looks of the rough ice beneath him, and he
meant to reach the island as speedily as possible.
Soon he saw that he was flying faster than the
bootlegger ahead of him. But as he had only a
few miles to go, he thought he should hardly
overtake the man.</p>

<p>On they flew, Jimmy following straight after
the other plane, and all the time creeping up on
it. To fly to the island took less than ten minutes.
Yet Jimmy was glad enough when he neared the
shore, for he did not like the looks of the rough
pack ice beneath him. He had just started to
circle over the island, in order to search out a
landing place, when he noticed the bootlegger’s
plane acting crazily. Jimmy saw at once that
something was wrong with the craft. Also, he
saw that the pilot, who was already at the farther
end of the island, was making a desperate effort
to turn and effect a landing. The ship came
down fast, landing on ground that was none too
smooth, but was apparently not harmed, though
the running gear might have been broken.
About that, Jimmy could not be sure without a
close inspection.</p>

<p>Sweeping completely around the island, Jimmy
saw that there was no better place to land than
the open space in which the bootlegger had been
forced down. So he came down cautiously, in as
easy a glide as he could make, ready to give her
the gun instantly, should the place prove impossible.
But he found a long, fairly smooth stretch
before him, and set his ship down neatly in the
snow. She slid for some distance, then came to
rest in perfect safety.</p>

<p>Jimmy hopped from his plane and looked
about him. On one side was the other flying
machine, and the pilot of it was walking toward
him with great speed. On the other hand, at a
considerable distance, was a little group of houses,
doubtless the residences of the stricken islanders.
But they were evidently not all stricken, for several
men could be seen coming toward him.</p>

<p>For a moment Jimmy stood looking at them,
trying to count them. He was curious about
these isolated islanders, and not a little sympathetic
toward them. He wondered what sort
of people they would prove to be. And he was
eager to get their story, and to deliver the medicines.
He was also curious to know what manner
of man the bootlegger would prove to be. And
presently, hearing the latter’s step at hand, he
spun about to face him, and found himself looking
into the barrel of a revolver that the approaching
bootlegger had leveled at him.</p>

<p>Jimmy’s heart began to beat violently. He was
so utterly taken by surprise that he did not know
what to do or say. For a moment he was silent.
The bootlegger did the talking.</p>

<p>“Get back into your plane,” he said sharply.</p>

<p>Jimmy did as ordered. There was nothing else
to do. To his astonishment the bootlegger
climbed into the plane after him, shut the door,
and sat down in one of the seats. The revolver
he still held in his hand menacingly.</p>

<p>“Take off as quick as you can,” he said gruffly.</p>

<p>Jimmy glanced at the advancing islanders and
played for time.</p>

<p>“What’s the big idea?” he asked, trying to
appear calm, though his heart was beating a
tattoo against his ribs.</p>

<p>“I just put a connecting-rod through my
crankcase,” growled the man.</p>

<p>“Then you want to be ferried ashore,” said
Jimmy. “Just as soon as I speak to these men
I’ll take you. I’ve got a package for them.”</p>

<p>The man raised his pistol. His face was black
as a thunder cloud. “If you know when you’re
well off, kid,” he snarled, “you’ll do what I tell
you. Hop off and hop off quick, or I’ll drill you
full of holes and fly your old crate myself.”
Jimmy saw that he was in a tight place. He
swung about and hopped off. He headed straight
back for Smithville.</p>

<p>“Turn her in the opposite direction,” growled
the man, “and just keep going.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>CHAPTER XIV</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:1.0em;'>Taking Help to Marooned Islanders</p>

<p>Jimmy obeyed the command with alacrity.
There was nothing else to do. In a moment
he was flying on precisely the same course he had
followed in coming to the island from Smithville.
Soon he was beyond Duck Island and heading
for Prince Edward, that great, bold Canadian
peninsula that thrusts out far into the lake. A
long point of land reached straight out toward
Duck Island. Jimmy could see this point easily,
for it was hardly more than a dozen miles in an
air-line. At some distance from the end of this
point were small islands, and they were almost
in Jimmy’s line of flight. Five or eight minutes
of flying would take him to land again, so he had
no apprehensions about the short flight over this
reach of open lake.</p>

<p>But Jimmy wasn’t at all comfortable in his
mind about other aspects of the situation. If the
bootlegger wanted simply to be carried across to
Canada because his own plane had gone bad, that
was one thing. Jimmy didn’t in the least object
to ferrying a man over a dozen miles of lake—even
a bootlegger—if the man was in trouble.
But would that be the end of the matter?</p>

<p>Now that the bootlegger’s own plane was out
of commission, he might decide to take Jimmy’s.
That wasn’t such a pleasant prospect. But there
was still another angle to the situation. If the
man seized the plane, would he not almost necessarily
feel compelled to get rid of the evidence
of his crime? In short, would he not find it
expedient to get rid of Jimmy? When Jimmy
thought of the old saying, so commonly quoted
by criminals, that “dead men tell no tales,” he
could feel the cold shivers run up and down his
spine.</p>

<p>Jimmy wanted to turn around and talk to his
captor. He felt as though a bullet might come
crashing through his back at any instant. It
seemed to him that he simply must look around
and face the bootlegger. Yet he hesitated. The
man had told him to fly straight on. That was
evidently what the fellow wanted—to get to his
destination. He was getting there, and he seemed
satisfied. Jimmy decided that the best course
was to attend to his flying and make careful note
of the country over which he passed, together
with the compass bearings, rate of speed,
prominent landmarks, etc., so that if he had
the opportunity to fly back, he could find his way. So
he centred his whole attention on the matter of
navigation and soon found that he felt relieved
in mind. He could think better. He was not so
oppressed by fear.</p>

<p>But Jimmy had far less time for thought than
he had anticipated. In six or seven minutes he
had reached the tip of the Prince Edward peninsula,
and in twenty minutes he was over the very
heart of this body of land. Still he kept on as
straight as the crow flies.</p>

<p>Now, for the first time, his unwelcome passenger
spoke. “Set her down in the open space
just ahead,” he said gruffly.</p>

<p>Jimmy eased his plane toward the ground and
throttled down his engine. The uniform
whiteness of the snow made it difficult for him to
distinguish the contour of the ground. But as
he came lower, he saw that there was a great,
smooth area ahead of him that had quite evidently
been used for landing planes. The snow was
streaked with the long parallel marks of giant
skis. Jimmy picked out a pair of ski marks and
set his ship down safely almost in the very treads
he was watching. The plane slid safely to rest.
The landing ground was in a lonely region, and
not a house or a human being was in sight.</p>

<p>“Get out,” said the man brusquely.</p>

<p>Jimmy stepped from the plane. His captor
followed.</p>

<p>“Now that you succeeded in tracking me
down, what do you intend to do with your information?”
he demanded, as he toyed with his
revolver suggestively.</p>

<p>“Tracking you down!” exclaimed Jimmy,
amazed. “I don’t even know what you are talking
about. I never saw you before, never heard
of you, and certainly never tried to trail you.
Where did you get that idea?”</p>

<p>The man looked at him uncertainly. “Ain’t
you one of them government prohibition agents?”
he asked.</p>

<p>A great light dawned upon Jimmy’s mind.
He actually laughed. “That’s a good one,” he
exclaimed. “So you took me for a ‘dry’ agent.
No, I’m not a government agent. I’m a newspaper
reporter. I represent the New York
<span class='it'>Morning Press</span>. Look at the name on the side of
my ship.”</p>

<p>“I can’t read,” said the man. “It makes no
difference if you are a newspaper man. You was
on my trail.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got another guess,” said Jimmy. “I
flew up here to carry medicines to some people
on Duck Island who are sick. We just got a
newspaper despatch telling about them. There’s
a whole family dying over there because they lack
medicine. Nobody could get to them because of
the ice. My boss used to live up this way, and
when he read the despatch he sent me up to help
them.”</p>

<p>The bootlegger looked at Jimmy intently.
“You don’t look like you was lyin’,” he said.</p>

<p>“Of course I’m not lying,” protested Jimmy.</p>

<p>“Here’s the medicine.” And stepping into the
plane, he picked up the bulky package he had
been transporting and opened it.</p>

<p>The rum runner looked at it and then at
Jimmy. “Say, kid,” he blurted out suddenly,
“you’re all right. To think you’d come clean
from New York and risk your life flyin’ over the
lake just to help some sick folks. By Joe! I’ll
look in on them folks myself, next time I go
over the island. If they need help, they need it
quick I reckon. So you’d better be on your way.
I’m much obliged for the ride. Maybe this’ll
square things with you.” And he reached into his
pocket, pulled out a huge roll of bills, peeled off
a one hundred dollar gold certificate and thrust
it into Jimmy’s hand. “Now you better hustle,”
he said.</p>

<p>Jimmy was too much astonished for words.
He did not want to take the man’s money. He
wanted less to cross the fellow, for the rum
runner was quite evidently a desperate character.
Wisely, Jimmy decided to go while the going was
good. He handed the bill back to the man.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” he said. “It will be worth more to
me if you will look after those people on the
island. Spend the money for them. I probably
can’t get up here again. Good-bye.” And
climbing into his plane, Jimmy was off as soon
as he could lift his ship from the snow. He
opened his throttle wide. In a minute he was far
away, beyond the possible range of any pursuing
bullet that might come his way. He breathed
freely again, and flew straight as an arrow back
toward the island.</p>

<p>Once fairly aloft, Jimmy began to meditate on
his adventure. Suddenly an idea came to him.
“Gee!” he thought. “I’m sure glad this was
such an isolated place we landed in. I don’t believe
there was a soul within miles. It was a
good thing, too. Nobody could get my license
number. If any one had noticed it, I might get
into a jam with the Canadian officials for landing
on Canadian soil without clearing the customs.
Well, I guess I had a good excuse, anyway.
But just the same, I’m glad nobody could
get my number.”</p>

<p>As he approached the island, he saw a group
of people clustered about the bootlegger’s
airplane. They were examining it carefully. Evidently
they had been much mystified by what had
taken place. They came thronging eagerly about
Jimmy’s plane as he set it down in the snow.</p>

<p>Jimmy stepped from his ship, with the medicines
in his hand. “I am from the New York
<span class='it'>Morning Press</span>,” he said. “We received a
despatch a few hours ago from Smithville, saying
that you were cut off here by the ice and that
people were very sick with pneumonia and lacked
medicines. My paper has sent you the drugs you
need, and some directions for using them.”</p>

<p>When Jimmy saw the expressions of gratitude
that came on the faces of the people about him,
he felt that he was more than repaid for anything
he had done or could do to help them.</p>

<p>“Come with us,” they said. “We want you to
talk to some of the people that are in trouble.”</p>

<p>Jimmy went with them. Neighbors were caring
for the stricken family. One or two of the
ailing ones were too sick to be seen. But Jimmy
was able to talk briefly to the mother of the
family and the oldest boy. He got from them
their story, which was a startling tale in itself.
The entire family of seven—father, mother,
and five children—had gone, some days previously,
to pay a visit to friends on the mainland.
The lake was not then frozen so solidly. There
were wide, open leads of water, which made it
easily possible to reach the mainland. The visit
lasted several days. Just before the return home,
the great cold wave came. When they were
half-way to the island, their motor went dead. A
storm came up, and they drifted helplessly before
it for twelve hours. The waves washed into their
boat until they were all drenched. They could
do nothing but sit in their boat and pray that the
ice would not crush it. Their situation had finally
been discovered, and hardy neighbors, taking
their lives in their hands, had launched the most
powerful boat on the island and fought their way
to them. Thus their lives were saved for the time
being, although every one of the seven was
stricken with pneumonia, and it looked as though
two of the seven might die. There was just a
chance that the arrival of the medicine might
arrest the disease.</p>

<p>Jimmy was powerfully affected by this recital.
He had seldom been so close to human suffering.
Never had he been in touch with people so pitifully
situated as these folks had been. Glad, indeed,
was he that he had attempted the journey,
and that there were great newspapers like his
own, to take upon themselves the relief of suffering
and the righting of wrong when other
agencies failed.</p>

<p>One thing was sure, Jimmy thought. These
suffering ones certainly must have medical treatment.
And so, taking a hasty departure, he flew
back to Smithville and got into touch with his
chief, setting the story before him fully.</p>

<p>“Get a doctor and rush him to the island,” Mr.
Johnson wired back.</p>

<p>Jimmy secured the only physician in the neighborhood,
loaded the doctor and the necessary supplies
in his plane, and was soon back on the
island. The medical assistance came in time.
The doctor was able to give immediate treatments
and to leave directions for further care.</p>

<p>As for Jimmy himself, nothing was too good
for him on the island. The inhabitants would
have given him almost anything he asked for, so
grateful were they for his efforts in their behalf.
But Jimmy wanted nothing. He was more than
repaid by their gratitude and their friendship.</p>

<p>It was with real regret that Jimmy said goodbye
to these new-found friends. He was amazed
to see how rapidly a mutual feeling of regard
had sprung up between these people and himself
in such a short time. He understood, of course,
that this was because of the unusual conditions
under which they had come to know one another.
When the time for departure came, he shook
hands with them all, promised to come back to
the island some time, and then ferried his doctor
back to Smithville. And now he went winging
his way home across the great Empire State, to
his old quarters at the Long Island flying field.</p>

<p>Weeks later Jimmy learned that the rescue
efforts he had set in motion had been wholly successful.
Every one of the seven sufferers had
recovered. But more astonishing than that was
the news that for a week after Jimmy’s departure,
the sick islanders had daily treatment
from the Smithville physician. The rum runner
from Canada had flown the physician back and
forth every day, as long as it was necessary, in a
new plane, and had concluded the matter by paying
the doctor handsomely for his services.</p>

<p>Jimmy mused over this for quite a while. “It
just shows,” he concluded, “that the poet was
right when he said there is so much bad in the
best of us and so much good in the worst of us
that we ought to be mighty careful what we say
about anybody.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>CHAPTER XV</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:1.0em;'>Jimmy Joins the Caterpillar Club</p>

<p>For many weeks after Jimmy’s return from
this trip he found life tame and colorless,
although he was busy enough. There were flying
assignments aplenty; but Jimmy found them
very ordinary experiences. The day had long since
passed when Jimmy could get a thrill
merely by making a flight in the air. And that
was about all his assignments now amounted to.
One of the first of these flying assignments was
a commission to hunt for a lost yacht. A small
pleasure craft had disappeared somewhere along
the Atlantic coast between New York and Boston.
It was not known whether the craft was
floating helplessly on the sea, or whether it had
put in at some isolated harbor, or whether it
might have gone down, with all on board. The
owner was a man of importance. With a small
group of friends he had ventured out on the
ocean, and the party had utterly vanished. Great
anxiety was felt for their safety, and because of
the social and business prominence of the missing
man, the newspapers joined in the hunt.</p>

<p>Jimmy had little expectation of finding the lost
yacht. The story promised to be an easy one to
cover. Jimmy would fly until he found the boat
or failed to find it. In the one case there would
be nothing to write, or next to nothing, whereas
in the other there would be little to do, probably,
except drop a note to the boat, promising aid,
then fly back to land and send out a relief ship,
and finally to write a story to the effect that the
missing boat had been found.</p>

<p>Jimmy secured permission to take Johnnie
with him on this trip. Or, to be more exact, the
city editor assigned Johnnie the job of flying
with Jimmy. And that was about all the assignment
amounted to. They flew for hours, and
covered a tremendous stretch of shore-line and
coastal waters, but discovered no trace of the
missing ship. They got back to the hangar cold,
hungry, and stiff, and Jimmy at least was thoroughly
disgusted. To Johnnie the trip was thrilling
enough.</p>

<p>Soon afterward Jimmy made a flight that was
far more interesting. The managing editor telephoned
him to get ready to fly to Auburn, New York,
where rioting had broken out in the state
prison. Handley was sent along to write a story,
for this was a two-man job. The flight up state
was ordinary enough, but the riot within the
prison walls was far different. Buildings were
afire, prisoners were armed, guards were located
in strategic positions, and a real battle was in
progress within the walls, while outside were
ranged troops and policemen, hastily collected
and thrown about the institution to prevent a
general escape of prisoners.</p>

<p>When Jimmy reached the place he found his
was the first airplane on the job. He flew over
the prison so that he and Handley could get a
good view of what was going on within the walls.
He saw in a moment that a real battle was raging.
From the building that had fallen into the
hands of the rioters bullets were evidently flying
in volleys. Prison guards were answering with
an incessant rifle fire. Within the walls things
were smashed and broken. Flames were blazing
high. Structures had been set on fire by
the rioters. It was impossible for firemen to get
into the buildings to fight the flames.</p>

<p>Again and again Jimmy circled over the
prison, while Handley took snapshots of the
scene. Then Jimmy landed his ship and Handley
left him, to gather the remainder of his story
on the ground and put it on the wire, while
Jimmy himself sped back to New York with his
photographs.</p>

<p>Long afterward he learned that, altogether
unknown to himself, he had played a most important
part in subduing the mob and restoring
authority and order in the prison. For some of
the rioters later told the guards that when
Jimmy’s plane appeared and began to circle
above the prison, the rioters were certain it was
an army bomber, hovering above them with intent
to blow them all to eternity should they get the
upper hand of the guards. That belief broke
their fighting spirit. They knew they hadn’t a
chance to succeed. And scores of rioters gave up
at once.</p>

<p>The prison riot assignment was followed by
one to cover a big railroad wreck, and that in turn
by an order to assist in a search for four coastwise
fliers who had taken off in the South, with intent
to race a fast train to New York, and who had
utterly disappeared. Jimmy flew for hours along
the Atlantic coast, but like other fliers who were
engaged in the same task, discovered absolutely
no trace of the missing airmen.</p>

<p>By this time Jimmy’s engine was in need of
overhauling. Indeed, it had somewhat alarmed
him on his homeward flight from the search for
the lost fliers. But he had made his airport
safely, though he felt sure he could not have
flown much farther. His engine was not only
beginning to miss badly, but it quite evidently
needed attention.</p>

<p>At once Jimmy got the managing editor on the
telephone. “Mr. Johnson,” he said, “the engine
in my plane will have to be ‘pulled’ right away.
I can’t make another flight until it has had a
thorough overhauling. I’ve flown this ship more
than 500 hours, with only one top overhaul of
the motor. In the Air Mail we used to 'pull’ the
motors every time they had done 500 hours. I
just barely got back safely to-day.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the managing editor. “Arrange
to have your plane overhauled at once.
How long will it take?”</p>

<p>“It’s a pretty long job, Mr. Johnson. I
should judge it would take two weeks. As long
as the ship has to be laid up, we might as well
have it checked over thoroughly. While they are
working on the engine, we ought to have the
wings inspected internally, to see that all the
fittings are in shape and to see if any drag wires
need tightening. We might need new pins in the
hinges of the control surfaces, and some of the
control cables may need replacing. The brakes
should be taken up, too. In fact, there’s no end
of things that ought to be checked over. It’s a
big job, but it must be done. It isn’t safe to fly
the ship any longer without a complete overhaul.”</p>

<p>“That’s too bad,” said the managing editor,
“but if it is necessary have it done. The difficulty
is not about the repairs, but about the loss
of the use of the plane. We simply can’t get
along without a plane. Is there a ship you can
hire if the need arises?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. There’s an old open cockpit
<span class='it'>Travelair-Whirlwind</span> here, Mr. Johnson. It’s an
old-timer, but it has a good engine and flies well.
We can hire it for very little. But I suggest
that you do not wait till the need arises, for
somebody else might have the plane out at the
very moment we want it.”</p>

<p>“Then go hire it at once, Jimmy, for as long
a time as you think you will be without your
ship.”</p>

<p>“I think they will rush my work if I ask them
to do it,” said Jimmy. “I am sure they can have
the job finished inside of two weeks. Suppose I
charter this old ship for that period.”</p>

<p>“Very well, if that is long enough. If it isn’t,
make it longer. We mustn’t be caught without a
plane. You never can tell when a story will
break that will have to be covered by flight.”</p>

<p>Jimmy rented the old <span class='it'>Travelair-Whirlwind</span>
and had it moved to his hangar. His own ship
was rolled away to the shop, where the mechanics
could work at it conveniently. Then Jimmy
transferred to his new plane all the equipment
that he ordinarily carried in his own ship—maps,
camera, flash-light, and similar necessary articles.
Also, he got out his flying suits, for now he would
have to ride in the open.</p>

<p>It was well that Jimmy acted promptly about
the old ship; for hardly had he gotten her ready
for flight before the managing editor was on the
wire again.</p>

<p>“Jimmy,” he said, “I’ll have to ask you to
jump right out on another flight. Is everything
all right about your new plane?”</p>

<p>“Everything is O. K., Mr. Johnson. I’ve had
her rolled into my hangar and serviced. I’ve put
all my outfit aboard of her. She’s ready to fly
at a minute’s notice, and so am I. Where do I
go this time?”</p>

<p>“Jimmy,” said the managing editor, “this is
a very serious and important mission which I am
about to entrust to you. One of the under secretaries
of war from Washington was here to talk
to me about certain matters that are to be decided
at the peace conference in London, now in
session. I cannot tell you what these things are,
but they are affairs of great moment. The under
secretary left my office to go to Chicago. I have
just found that he left some very important
papers behind him. These he absolutely must
have in Chicago, where he is going for a conference
before he starts for Europe. I could stop
him by a telegram sent to his train, but it is
highly important that he be in Chicago at the
earliest possible moment. He must not be delayed
a second. At the same time, he absolutely
must have these papers. What I want you to do
is to get them into his hands. Deliver them to
him in person and to no one else.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Johnson. Have you any suggestions?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been studying maps and time tables,
Jimmy, and I think you can do this nicely. If
you fly to Bellefonte, which is right on the lighted
airway, you can there take a motor car to Tyrone,
which is perhaps thirty miles distant. The train
on which the under secretary is traveling is due
to stop at Tyrone. There you can board his train
and put the papers into his hands. I will wire
him on the train that the papers he left in my
office are going ahead by plane, and will be
handed him at Tyrone.”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t possibly have planned the thing
out any better, Mr. Johnson,” replied Jimmy.
“I know that whole section well. From Bellefonte
I shall drive to Milesburg, where I hit the
new cement road from Lock Haven to Tyrone.
It is as fine a strip of cement as there is in the
United States. It runs along the Bald Eagle
Creek, and for miles is as level as a floor. A
motor car can almost fly along there. But you
should have a car at the flying field to meet me.
The field is several miles outside of the town of
Bellefonte, and I’ll save a lot of time if the car
is on hand when I arrive.”</p>

<p>“Very well. I’ll telegraph for a car and it
will be at the flying field when you arrive. How
soon can you take off, and how long will it take
you to reach Bellefonte?”</p>

<p>“It’s 215 miles from here to Bellefonte, by the
lighted airway. I can’t expect to get much more
than 100 miles an hour out of this plane, and if
there is a strong west wind I can’t do nearly as
well as that. It will probably take me two hours
and a half and perhaps even three hours. I
should be in Tyrone within another hour, easily.”</p>

<p>“That ought to give you plenty of time,
Jimmy. The secretary’s train was due to leave
Philadelphia at 6:30&nbsp;p&nbsp;m. So it has been under
way about fifteen minutes, for it is now quarter
of seven. It takes the train five hours and a
quarter to reach Tyrone from Philadelphia.
That should put it there at 11:45. If it should
be late, it may not reach there before midnight.
You should have an hour’s leeway.”</p>

<p>“I will if I can get off soon,” said Jimmy,
“but what about the papers? How am I to get
hold of them promptly?”</p>

<p>“They should be in your hands within a few
minutes. Handley is rushing them to you in a
fast taxi. He also has some money for you.
You may need more cash than perhaps you have
in your pocket.”</p>

<p>“Very well, sir. I’ll start my engine to warming,
and be ready to take off the instant Handley
gets here. Good-bye. I’ll do my best, Mr.
Johnson.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Jimmy. The best of luck to you.
Let me have a wire from you as soon as you put
the papers in the secretary’s hands.”</p>

<p>Jimmy rang off and ran out into the hangar
to warm his engine. Then he inspected his ship
to make sure he had every necessary piece of
equipment. Before he had finished his inspection,
a taxi rushed up and Handley stepped out.</p>

<p>“Here are your papers and your money,
Jimmy. I suppose the Old Man phoned you
about them. I hope you have a quick trip. The
best of luck to you.”</p>

<p>Jimmy thanked his colleague and stowed the
papers and the money in an inner coat pocket,
where he could not possibly lose them. Then he
pulled on his flying suit, buckled on his parachute,
climbed into his cockpit, nodded good-bye
to his mechanic, and soared up into the night.</p>

<p>As he left the earth, Jimmy glanced at his
clock. It was exactly seven. He looked aloft,
into the night. The sky was a deep, dark blue.
Stars shone dimly through a slight haze. He
could see quite well. “If it stays like this,” he
thought, “I won’t have a bit of trouble to get
there. But I sure do wish I had my own ship.
These open cockpit planes certainly are back
numbers.”</p>

<p>Jimmy centred his attention on his instruments,
and was soon satisfied that everything was
working perfectly. His plane seemed to function
better than he had expected it would. He covered
the thirty-five miles to Hadley Field in a fraction
more than twenty minutes. “That’s almost 105
miles an hour,” thought Jimmy. “I didn’t believe
the old boat would do it. But it will be a
different story when I turn west and face the
wind. There’s only a twelve-mile breeze blowing,
they said, but even that will cut me down to
ninety miles an hour.”</p>

<p>He flew along the old familiar airway. The
visibility was good. Beneath him he could see the
clustered lights of town after town, as he roared
across New Jersey. He knew every town as he
passed over it. He checked time and distance as
he flew along. It seemed almost no time before
he was approaching Easton. He thought of
Rand, and the latter’s effort to trick him; and he
was glad it had happened. It had resulted in
Johnnie Lee’s getting the job he was so eager
to have.</p>

<p>Westward Jimmy roared along, straight as the
crow flies. Beneath him, on hill and meadow,
shone the beacon lights, stretching out before him
in an endless row of revolving lights. For miles
ahead of him he could see these friendly beacons.</p>

<p>Before he knew it he was over Sunbury. He
noticed that the haze was increasing rapidly. He
thought it might be fog rolling up from the
Susquehanna. Soon he was at the Woodward
Pass. There was the lofty beacon on the brow
of Winkelblech Mountain. Jimmy was high
above it. Now he was past the mountain and soaring
over Penn’s Valley. A very few minutes
would put him into Bellefonte. He glanced at
his clock. He had made amazingly good time.
He was going to reach Bellefonte in close to two
and a half hours after all.</p>

<p>Now he was passing Millheim, with its blazing
beacon on the crest of Nittany Mountain. The
mist was increasing. It bade fair to be bad. But
it could not gather quick enough to interfere with
him. In no time he would be in Bellefonte.
But suddenly his struts and wires began to
hum and vibrate. The vibration rapidly grew
worse. The humming grew into a screech.
Jimmy’s blood began to run cold. His plane was
icing up. The thing most feared by airmen was
happening to him. Along the edges of his wings,
he knew, ice was forming, as the mist froze fast to
the fabric. If it continued to form, it would
destroy the shape of his wings. They would lose
their lifting power. Then nothing under heaven
could keep him aloft.</p>

<p>And his wings <span class='it'>were</span> icing up rapidly. He could
tell that from the feeling of the plane beneath
him. It no longer slid through the air with its
smooth, hawk-like passage. Its flight was becoming
uncertain. It trembled and shook. The ship
responded but slowly to his control. Desperately
he strove to climb. If he could reach either a
colder or a warmer stratum of air, the ice would
melt. He dared not descend, for beneath him
were these terrible mountains. He found it impossible
to climb. The ship had utterly lost its
power to do so. Yet Jimmy fought with all his
ability to force the craft upward. He tried every
trick he had ever heard of, to lift the plane higher.
He could not gain an inch.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Jimmy knew full well that
he was coming down. His altimeter showed that
he was losing altitude steadily. He had been
flying at 5,000 feet elevation. Already he was
down to 4,500 feet. The mountain beneath him
towered up to 2,000 feet. If only he could make
the next few miles, and get over the high crests
near Bellefonte, he would be all right. The landing
field was at an elevation of only 1,200 feet.
He believed he could glide down into it in safety.</p>

<p>But suddenly his plane began to spin. It was
absolutely out of control. Frantically Jimmy
kicked at his rudder, shifted his ailerons, tried
every trick he knew of to get the ship out of the
spin. He could do absolutely nothing with it.
The plane was beyond all control.</p>

<p>With dismay Jimmy realized that he was in a
flat spin. He thought of Jack Webster, the mail
pilot, who had been caught in exactly the same
way just a few miles farther west only a few
months previously. The thought made Jimmy’s
heart stop beating. For the centripetal force of
that spin had held the mail pilot fast in his
cockpit, and he had fallen with his plane and been
cruelly injured.</p>

<p>Jimmy knew that there was not a second to
lose. He must get out of the ship, and get out
quick. He thought of Warren Long. He tried
to keep his head. He reached for his switches
and shut off his ignition, to prevent an explosion
when the ship struck. Then he dropped both of
his flares. They burst on the night like magnificent
rockets, lighting up the mountain below them,
like noonday. Jimmy took a single look over the
side of his ship and began to struggle frantically
to get out of his cockpit. Below him was nothing
but jagged rocks and menacing tree growths.</p>

<p>Vainly he struggled. He could not lift himself
out of the ship. Had the craft been under
control, he could have flipped it over and catapulted
himself out of the cockpit. But the plane
was going down on level keel, whirling about like
a top. Again Jimmy struggled. Desperately
he fought to get out of his seat. With all his
strength he pulled at the sides of the ship and
shoved upward with his legs. Still he was held
fast, as by a giant hand. Again he heaved his
body upward, convulsively, frantically, with terrible
effort. This time he was successful. He
gained his feet. As he did so, he could see over
the side of his ship.</p>

<p>The mountain was rising up to meet him at a
terrifying pace. He was frightfully close to the
ground. Snatching up his flash-light, he stepped
out on the wing, then dived headlong into space.</p>

<p>He held his breath, fearful lest the whirling
plane should strike him. It missed him by inches.
He fought for self-control, lest he should pull the
rip-cord too soon and cause his own death.
Plainly he could see the spinning ship above him.
He was going down head first, just as Warren
Long had gone. Now he judged he was safe.
Instantly he tore at the rip-cord. The steel ring
came away in his hand. The parachute snapped
out with a crack. It came ballooning open. With
a jerk that almost knocked him senseless, Jimmy
was snapped into an upright position. Then he
went floating straight down.</p>

<p>Instantly he looked below him to see what was
there. Then he glanced above, fearful that the
falling ship might drop on him. The wind bore
him slightly to one side of the descending plane.
Jimmy drew a breath of relief and centred his attention
on the ground at his feet. The flares were
dying out. He snapped on his flash-light. At
first it seemed terribly feeble. Then his eyes
grew accustomed to the altered light. He saw
he was going to land in some saplings. His feet
went crashing down through the tree tops.
Branches broke beneath him. They also broke
his fall. Jimmy reached out and grabbed a little
limb. It tore away from the tree trunk under his
weight. But it almost stopped his descent. Desperately
he clutched at another branch. This one
was tougher and bigger. It held. Jimmy found
himself motionless, not ten feet from the ground.
He had suffered only a few bruises and scratches.
He slid the rest of the way down the tree. He
was on his feet, safe and sound.</p>

<p>But he was in a terrible plight. Five minutes
more in the air would have put him into Bellefonte
in safety. Now he was miles from the flying
field, deep in the mountains, in the black of
night.</p>

<p>Yet he had one advantage. He was not lost.
He knew almost exactly where he was. Even as
he was falling he had noticed the beacon at
Mingoville. Now as he turned his powerful
flash-light this way and that, he saw that he had
landed in a notch. He knew it must be the
Mingoville notch. And if it was, there was a trail
running through it. He tore off the parachute
and made his way down the slope of the notch
to the bottom. Sure enough, here was the trail.
Jimmy knew it led directly into Mingoville.</p>

<p>Recklessly he raced down it. The powerful
ray from his flash-light illuminated the path
ahead of him. Its beam, almost horizontal,
showed him the irregularities of the way better
even than the noonday sun would have done.
Under other circumstances he would not have
dared to run down this rough mountain path as
he was now tearing along it. But he used the
utmost care in striding, and succeeded in missing
loose stones that would have turned his ankle.</p>

<p>Down the trail he ran, panting, sweating, his
heart pounding in his breast. But never for a
moment did he slacken his speed. In ten minutes
the trail opened into a road. Not far away was a
house, and through a window a light was shining.</p>

<p>Jimmy ran toward the house, shouting as he
ran. A man stepped out of the door as he came
panting up.</p>

<p>“I just jumped out of an airplane,” said
Jimmy, “and I’ve got to get to Bellefonte at
once. Have you got a car?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said the mountaineer deliberately.</p>

<p>“I’ll pay you $25 to take me to Bellefonte.
And if you get me there quick, I’ll make it $30,”
said Jimmy. “I’m trying to catch a man for
whom I have important despatches. I have to
get there in the least time possible.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take you,” said the mountaineer.</p>

<p>“Hurry,” panted Jimmy.</p>

<p>The man ran for his barn. The car was inside.
It was an old Ford. Jimmy groaned when he
saw it. The man started to crank it. To Jimmy
it seemed as though the thing would never start.
But finally it coughed, then began to explode
regularly. The motor sounded good to Jimmy.
The man drew on an old overcoat that was in the
car. “Get in,” he said. Jimmy obeyed with
alacrity. The man let in his clutch and the car
rolled out into the road.</p>

<p>“Drive as fast as you can make her go,” urged
Jimmy. “I have very important despatches for
an official of the government. I simply must
catch him. He’s on his way west. If you hurry,
there’s a chance.”</p>

<p>The man threw caution to the winds. Twenty-five
dollars was more money than he had seen at
one time in years. He opened the throttle wide.
The little Ford tore along the road. It roared
and rattled. It bounced and swayed. When it
struck a bump it leaped like a rabbit. But the
man never slackened his speed and Jimmy clung
to the seat desperately.</p>

<p>“I want to go to the flying field,” said Jimmy.
“There’s a car waiting for me there to take me to
Tyrone.”</p>

<p>“I’ll put you there in no time,” said the mountaineer.</p>

<p>Jimmy looked at his watch. There was just a
possibility that he could make it if everything
went well. Jimmy sat in silence. But his heart
was beating fast with anxiety and apprehension.</p>

<p>On they raced through the night. The man
seemed to know the road perfectly. He tore
around sharp bends, dashed into dark hollows,
went roaring along the straight stretches, almost
without altering his pace. Suddenly he applied
the brakes. Then he shot around a sharp corner.
Ahead of them lights were gleaming. Jimmy
recognized the flying field. He thrust his hand
into his pocket, drew out his roll of bills, and
counted out $30. As the Ford came to a stop
before the hangar, Jimmy thrust the money into
the driver’s hand, leaped from the car, and raced
for a powerful, big motor that stood a few rods
distant.</p>

<p>He ran up to the driver, who was sitting on the
front seat.</p>

<p>“Is this the car engaged by the New York
<span class='it'>Morning Press</span> to take a man to Tyrone?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the driver, in surprise. “He’s
coming in by plane and ought to have been here
some time ago. I’m beginning to be alarmed
about him. Know anything about him?”</p>

<p>“I’m the man,” said Jimmy, climbing into the
car. “My plane iced up and fell near Mingoville,
but I wasn’t hurt. Get started, please.”</p>

<p>The driver was off like a shot. Jimmy looked
at his watch.</p>

<p>“You’ve got thirty-five minutes to make it,”
he said.</p>

<p>The driver’s only response was to put on more
speed. Over rough roads he went spinning, as
recklessly as the mountaineer had done in his
Ford. But the great car he drove took up shocks
and the speed did not seem so great. Jimmy
wanted to protest, but when he glanced at the
speedometer he thought better of it. He sat in
silence, watching the road, as they went roaring
along.</p>

<p>Once on the cement highway, the driver opened
his throttle, and Jimmy watched the indicator
on the dashboard creep up. From forty-five miles
an hour it climbed to fifty, to fifty-five, to sixty,
to seventy, to eighty miles an hour. And there
the speedometer finger stood as though glued to
the spot.</p>

<p>They neared Tyrone. Jimmy watched the
lights draw near. The driver began to slacken
his speed. They reached the fringes of the town.
Close at hand Jimmy heard a long, shrill blast
of a locomotive whistle. He knew it was a train
blowing for Tyrone. It was going to stop. He
glanced at his watch. It lacked two minutes of
being 11:45.</p>

<p>“Step on it,” begged Jimmy. “That’s the
train I must catch.”</p>

<p>The driver turned a corner and straightened
out for a dash. He shoved his speed up and up
while Jimmy sat with his heart in his mouth.
They could never stop if anything came out of
a side street.</p>

<p>But nothing did. They roared on to the station.
The train was standing at the platform.
The locomotive was panting restlessly, as though
eager to be off.</p>

<p>“All aboard,” came a deep voice through the
night.</p>

<p>Jimmy leaped from the still moving car, and
raced down the platform toward the train. The
train began to move. Jimmy put everything he
had into a last desperate sprint. He reached the
car vestibule just as the conductor was closing
the door. Jimmy grabbed the hand rail and
swung up on the step. The conductor slammed
the door open and grabbed him.</p>

<p>“Is the—assistant secretary—of war—on this
train?” panted Jimmy.</p>

<p>“He is,” said the conductor.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>CHAPTER XVI</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:1.0em;'>The Bootlegger Repays Jimmy’s Kindness</p>

<p>Jimmy delivered his papers to the under secretary
and got a receipt for them. He left
the train at Altoona, wired the managing editor
a brief statement of his experiences, then registered
at a hotel and went to bed. Utterly worn
out by his trying efforts, he slept like a stone and
did not awaken until almost noon the following
day. Then he ate some breakfast, hired a taxi-cab,
and drove back to Mingoville. He sought
out the mountaineer who had driven him to Tyrone
on the preceding night, and the two climbed
the notch and found the fallen <span class='it'>Travelair</span>. It was
a complete “washout,” but Jimmy found that his
camera was not much harmed, and he secured his
maps, a compass that was still intact, his parachute,
and a few other articles. Then he had
the mountaineer drive him back to Bellefonte,
whence he made his way by train to New York,
where he reported at once to the managing editor.</p>

<p>“So you decided to join the Caterpillar Club,
did you?” said Mr. Johnson, speaking jestingly
but shaking Jimmy warmly by the hand. “I’m
mighty glad to see you back, <span class='it'>mighty glad</span>. I had
some real shivers when I read your telegram saying
that your plane had fallen and that you had
had to jump for your life. And I was more than
amazed to learn that, despite your accident, you
still succeeded in accomplishing your errand. It
must have been a tight squeeze, Jimmy. I want
to know how you did it.”</p>

<p>Jimmy fished out one of his topographic maps.
“I fell right here,” he said, putting his pencil
point on the spot that represented the gap above
Mingoville. “It was great luck. Had I been
a mile distant in almost any direction, I could
never have made that train at Tyrone.”</p>

<p>“It was a wonderful achievement, Jimmy. I
want to hear every particular of the story.”</p>

<p>Simply Jimmy related what had happened to
him, beginning his tale with the moment when he
felt his plane icing up.</p>

<p>“It’s a great story, Jimmy,” was the managing
editor’s only comment. “You should have told
me about it in your wire last night. I want you
to tell Handley what you have just told me. It
will make a great story for the <span class='it'>Press</span>. Of course
we must not betray the fact that the under secretary
of war lost some state papers. For the purpose
of this tale you were merely bearing confidential
despatches to him from the <span class='it'>Press</span>.”</p>

<p>So it happened that Jimmy once more figured
in the news columns. He disliked so much publicity.
But he understood that this was a great
story for his particular newspaper to print. The
thing that pleased him most was the fact that he
had made good. He had delivered the message
to Garcia. Nor was Jimmy at all displeased
when he found at the end of the week that he had
been given a nice bonus for his work.</p>

<p>His own ship was ready for flight once more
within the period that Jimmy had designated as
the time allowance for the job. But for some
time there was again a dearth of interesting assignments.
Meanwhile winter was succeeded by
early spring, the snow disappeared in the region
of New York, though there was plenty of it left
in the far north and would be for weeks to come.
Jimmy had the skis on his plane replaced by
wheels, for everywhere in the territory that he
was likely to cover there was now bare ground.</p>

<p>The first break in this new stretch of uninteresting
days came when Jimmy was sent to the
pine barrens of New Jersey, to take photographs
of a great forest fire that was sweeping through
the pines. Jimmy had seen forest fires in Pennsylvania,
but nothing like this crown fire that was
roaring through the pine woods in a line twenty-five
miles long, laying waste not only thousands
of acres of timber land, but utterly destroying
scores of homes within the forested area.</p>

<p>On another occasion he was sent down the Bay
to take photographs of an incoming steamer from
Europe that had effected a daring rescue in mid-ocean
of the crew of a sinking freighter.</p>

<p>But the assignment that gave Jimmy the greatest
thrill he had had in a long time was an order
to fly to the eastern end of Lake Ontario once
more, and cover the wreck of a lake steamer. This
craft, one of the first ships to make its way from
its winter harborage through the disintegrating
ice of the lake, had been caught in a terrible gale
and dashed on one of the small islands just off
Smithville.</p>

<p>Jimmy was atingle with enthusiasm the instant
he got word from the managing editor. It was
already well into the evening. Only a flash had
come—the merest hint of the great story that
eventually unfolded—saying that the steamer had
gone aground on the island. The storm had
somewhat abated, though it was still blowing
hard. But at the Long Island hangar there was
small evidence of any disturbance in the air.</p>

<p>“Would it be possible for you to get up there
to-night?” asked Mr. Johnson. “Or is it better
to wait until morning? If you <span class='it'>could</span> reach the
scene to-night, we could almost certainly get
something into our city edition about the wreck.
That goes to press at 3:30 in the morning. But
we could hold it, or we could get out an extra.
What do you think about it, Jimmy?”</p>

<p>“We ought to be able to do it, Mr. Johnson.
Of course, it depends upon what the flying is like
farther north. But right here the air is quiet
enough. At the very least, I could fly until I was
forced down. Then I’d be just so much nearer
the spot, and could doubtless get there quickly
by motor. The only difficulty is the one of landing.
There are no beacon lights to guide me and
no illuminated landing fields. A fellow always
runs a chance of 'washing out’ a ship when he
lands in the dark.”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t think it advisable to attempt
the trip to-night?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say that, Mr. Johnson. I’m going
to make the trip. But I wanted you to understand
the difficulties. I’ve been over the route,
and I can cover it again without difficulty. The
night is clear and there is starlight enough to illuminate
things a little. I know a number of
people at Smithville. I’ll wire to the postmaster
and ask him to burn a bucket of gasoline in the
field where I landed last winter. I can get down
all right, I’m sure. But the wire facilities are
not very good up there.”</p>

<p>“All right. I’ll get into touch with the Western
Union and see if we can’t get a wire ready for
your use. You make whatever arrangements are
necessary and get off as soon as you can. How
long should it take you to reach Smithville?”</p>

<p>“Unless I have to fight a stiff wind, I ought
to make it in two hours and a half. It’s almost
nine now. I ought to get there by midnight at
latest. In two hours more I ought to have a
story on the wire for you. We ought to catch the
city edition without difficulty.”</p>

<p>“Very well, make your arrangements and get
off. Have your mechanic telephone me the moment
you start.”</p>

<p>Jimmy instantly called the Western Union and
dictated a telegram to the postmaster of Smithville,
asking him to burn a bucket of gasoline in
the best landing field possible, when Jimmy approached
and circled the town. Unless held up
by wind, he said, he should be due in two hours
and a half. Then, without waiting for a reply,
Jimmy hopped off as soon as he could.</p>

<p>Straight up the Hudson flew Jimmy, speeding
along at 120 miles an hour, the pace he knew he
must make to land him at Smithville within the
designated time. He had no trouble in following
the Hudson to Albany, nor in going up the
Mohawk to Rome. His troubles began after he left
that point and started to follow the railroad to
Smithville, for the wind, which had been freshening
ever since he left Albany, was now blowing
half a gale. But it was a quartering wind for
Jimmy and did not delay him nearly so much as
a head wind would have done. It did make the
flight very rough and bumpy. But Jimmy wisely
flew at a good altitude, even though the wind was
stiffer up high, and in a little more than two hours
and a half was approaching Smithville.</p>

<p>He could make out the tossing expanse of the
lake. The lights of Smithville showed him exactly
where the village was, and his memory told him
just where the field should be in which he had
once landed. He nosed his ship downward and
started a big swing around the town. Lower and
lower he glided, waiting for the expected flare.
He was sure his running lights must be visible
from the ground, for the night was still perfectly
clear, though he was not so certain that the roar
of his motor could be heard. The blustering of
the wind might drown out the sound. At any
rate, they would be looking for him, and they
would see him. So he eased his plane earthward,
gliding lower and lower, and waiting for the flare.</p>

<p>Suddenly it came. A burst of flame sprang
up, though it was not where Jimmy had expected
to see it at all. It lighted up a wide expanse of
land. The place looked wet to Jimmy, but he
could not be sure about that. At any rate, it
undoubtedly was the best landing place possible.
He knew his friends would not pick out any other
landing place. So Jimmy shoved his stick over
a little more, shut off his engine, and glided down.
He leveled his ship off, let her lose flying speed,
and set her down. Instantly he knew that something
was wrong. Water began to fly. His
wheels gave forth squdgy, wallowing sounds.
In a second his plane bogged down. Over she
nosed into the soft ground. His propeller was
bent almost double. His under-carriage seemed
to give way. His engine plowed into the mud.
His tail was standing high in air.</p>

<p>Fortunately Jimmy had braced himself at the
first sound of splashing water. He was thrown
forward, and though his face was somewhat cut
and he suffered several hard bumps, he was not
really injured. Instantly he cut his switch and
shut off the gas. Then he leaped from the plane
to see what had happened. He found he was in
the centre of a great stretch of bog. His plane
was hopelessly mired and out of commission for
days.</p>

<p>At a distance he saw men with lanterns. He
splashed through the swampy ground toward
them. They came hurrying in his direction.
Foremost was the village postmaster.</p>

<p>“What in thunder did you make a flare in a
swamp for?” demanded Jimmy, mad as hops.
“My plane is completely out of commission.”</p>

<p>“We did just what you asked us to do,” replied
the postmaster, somewhat taken aback by
Jimmy’s fiery greeting.</p>

<p>“What I asked <span class='it'>you</span> to do!” said Jimmy.
“Why, I asked you to light a flare in the best
landing place available. Is that your idea of a
good landing place for a plane?”</p>

<p>“But in your second telegram you said to put
the flare in a swampy place as you would fly still
farther north from here and your ship still wore
skis.”</p>

<p>“My second telegram! My ship still wore
skis! I never sent you any second telegram. I
never told you I had skis on my ship.”</p>

<p>“Well, somebody did. Here’s the telegram.
It’s signed New York <span class='it'>Morning Press</span>.” And
the postmaster fished out of his pocket two yellow
telegram blanks and thrust them into Jimmy’s
hand.</p>

<p>“Somebody has played another trick on me,”
said Jimmy. “But it won’t do any good. My
ship may be disabled, but I am not. There’s still
the telegraph to fall back upon. I can get a
message back to New York that way.”</p>

<p>“But you’ll need your plane to fly out to the
wreck.”</p>

<p>“Thunderation!” said Jimmy. “Isn’t there
a boat to be had?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but it’s terribly rough. Nobody around
here would go out on the lake in a sea like the one
that’s running now.”</p>

<p>“Well, can I get the story of the wreck here?”</p>

<p>“No. Nobody knows a thing about it except
that the ship has piled up on the nearest island.
We can see her with our glasses. But that’s all
we know. That’s all we had to send to the newspapers.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t there any boat that can make it out to
the island? I’ll pay anybody well who’ll take me
out.”</p>

<p>“The only fellow who would dare it is that
bootlegger who held you up on your former trip
here. He stops at nothing. He’s got a boat
specially made for rough weather.”</p>

<p>“Where is he?” asked Jimmy. “Can I get
in touch with him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you can. He’s been in town for several
days. The lake has been too rough even for him.
I’ll show you where he hangs out.” And the
postmaster tramped off, with Jimmy at his side
and a group of villagers following behind them.</p>

<p>They found the rum runner. The man jumped
up suspiciously as they entered the house where
he was staying. He glanced from the postmaster
to Jimmy and back again. At first he did not
know the stranger. But before the postmaster
could say a word he remembered Jimmy’s face.
Instantly he held out his hand.</p>

<p>“Hello, Kid,” he said. “I reckon I know what
brings you back here. You gave me a ride across
the lake some time ago and I suspect you want
one in return? Do I win or lose on that guess?”</p>

<p>“You win,” said Jimmy, shaking the fellow’s
hand. “I want a ride and I want it bad.”</p>

<p>“You can get it,” said the rum runner. “I’ve
been out studying the lake for the last half hour.
The waves is dyin’ down fast. I’ve got a boat
that’ll make it easy. Once we get in the lee of
the island, there won’t be nothin’ to it—absolutely
nothin’.”</p>

<p>“How soon can we start?”</p>

<p>“Right off. Come on.”</p>

<p>The bootlegger’s power boat proved to be a
tremendously sturdy craft, with high prow, a
deep cabin roofed over, and the tiniest of cockpits
in the stern, where there was also an engine
that appeared to be of great power. Jimmy and
the owner climbed aboard. The latter turned on
an electric light.</p>

<p>“Put this on,” he said, handing Jimmy a lifebelt.
Then he drew on another himself.</p>

<p>He started his motor and let it run quietly a
few moments to heat up. Then he opened the
throttle to test it. The engine answered with a
roar as powerful as that of Jimmy’s plane. The
ship strained at her hawsers.</p>

<p>“Now, Kid, you go inside the cabin and sit
down. You’re likely to get hurt if you don’t.
If it gets too rough for you, just lay right down
in a bunk. Don’t take no chances on breakin’ an
arm or somethin’.”</p>

<p>Jimmy obeyed. The rum runner threw off his
lines. He opened his throttle. The ship left her
little harbor. In a moment she was tossing wildly
on the waves of the open lake. The owner gave
his engine more gas. The craft forged ahead.
Jimmy had never had such a ride. Like a chip
in a whirlpool the little boat was thrown about.
Now it leaped high upward. Now it dropped
downward with a suggestiveness that almost
made Jimmy sick. Now it struck a huge wave,
that came crashing back over it, and the impact
made the sturdy craft tremble and quiver. But
all the time it bored straight through the sea, its
motor roaring, its propeller whirling wildly as
the stern was thrown up out of the water. At
times it plunged headlong down the slope of a
great wave, only to go crashing into the following
crest. It shook and shivered. It groaned and
creaked. But not for one instant did the motor
falter or its deep-throated roar subside.</p>

<p>Almost before he knew it, Jimmy found himself
in calmer water. The boat still rose and fell.
It still rocked and swayed. But there was a
perceptible difference in its motions. They were
less violent. The sea was not so turbulent. The
craft wallowed less in the waves. And the farther
they went the smoother their passage continued
to grow.</p>

<p>Jimmy rightly guessed that the boat was in the
lee of the island. It was, in fact, driving into a
little cove or bay, well protected, on the leeward
side of the island. When Jimmy looked out and
saw land to right and left of him he was amazed.
They had made the trip to the island in astonishingly
little time. Despite wind and wave, the
rum runner’s powerful boat had crossed the three
miles of water with great speed. Now the craft
ran swiftly up the little bay and slid to a grating
stop at a little landing at the very end of the
cove.</p>

<p>“Come on,” said the rum runner, making his
boat fast. “I’ll take you over to the wreck.”</p>

<p>Rapidly he led the way across the island, which
just here was hardly a mile wide. Then the two
made their way out to the end of a long point of
land, on the tip of which lay the stranded vessel.
It was driven far up on the sands. Only a few
hundred feet of water separated it from the shore.
But those few hundred feet were frightful to behold.
On this windward side of the island the
sea was terrible. Huge waves came roaring in
from the open lake, to crash against the helpless
ship and go thundering completely over it.
Jimmy looked at the scene with an awe that
bordered on terror. Never before had he beheld
such an exhibition of the fury of wind and wave.</p>

<p>Near by was a cottage. Lights still shone in
the windows.</p>

<p>“The folks in that house ought to be able to
tell us something about the wreck,” shouted
Jimmy to his companion. “Let’s go talk to
them.”</p>

<p>They walked to the cottage and knocked at
the door. It was opened promptly and they
stepped inside. A great fire was blazing in the
hearth. Before it sat a man half dressed. Articles
of clothing were hanging before the blaze.
The man seemed distressed.</p>

<p>Jimmy introduced himself to the cottager. The
man recalled him at once as the flier who had
brought help from the city during the winter.</p>

<p>“What brings you here now? Is there anything
I can do for you?” asked the islander.</p>

<p>“I came to get the story of this stranded vessel.
Perhaps you can tell me something about
it.”</p>

<p>“I can,” said the cottager, “but this man can
tell you far more. He is the mate of the ship.
He was swept overboard and was all but drowned
before we got him ashore. He can tell you everything.”</p>

<p>Jimmy sat down and began to talk to him.
Reluctantly at first, then eagerly as he found relief
in conversation, the man related his story:
how the ship had put out from port at the first
possible moment with a cargo of freight and a
considerable passenger list; how progress had
been incredibly slow because of the heavy ice;
how the storm had caught them only a few miles
off shore; how the steamer’s propeller had been
broken by ice; and how she had then drifted helplessly
before the wind, finally to crash on the
beach before them, with the loss of many lives,
and the probable loss of many more. For it was
impossible to get to the ship with the sea as it was,
and the vessel was breaking up. It was only a
question of hours until it would go to pieces. Of
all those washed overboard—probably a score or
more—the mate was the only one who had reached
the shore alive.</p>

<p>For an hour Jimmy talked with the downcast
sailor. He plied the man with a hundred questions.
He got every detail of the trip, from the
start to the present moment. And he secured
many names of passengers and crew. Then
thanking the sailor and the cottager, he took his
leave, accompanied by his rum-running friend.</p>

<p>“Have you got all the facts you want?” asked
the latter.</p>

<p>“I’ve got all I have time to get now. I must
put what I have on the wire. Later I can get
more details and in the morning some pictures.”</p>

<p>They hurried to the boat, boarded it, and
crossed to the mainland, running before wind and
wave. Their speed amazed Jimmy. They made
the crossing in no time at all. Jimmy rushed to
the telegraph office, which he found open and
waiting for him, with an extra operator who had
been ordered on duty especially to forward
Jimmy’s story. Jimmy wrote a few lines and
handed them to the operator. Then, with the telegraph
key clicking in his ear, he wrote and wrote,
tearing off sheet after sheet from his pad and
handing each sheet to the operator as fast as it
was written. When he laid the last sheet before
the operator he glanced at the clock. It was half
past two. Jimmy smiled with happiness. He
had “caught” the city edition.</p>

<p>As Jimmy and his new friend came out of the
telegraph office they heard the hum of a plane
overhead. Down came a ship, circling, and settling
cautiously lower. Then it dropped a flare,
turned its landing lights on, and glided safely to
earth in a big field. Two men got out of it—the
pilot and a passenger. They hurried over to
Jimmy and the rum runner. In the dark Jimmy
did not recognize them.</p>

<p>“Is there any way we can get to the island,
where that ship is wrecked?” demanded one of
them. “We’ll pay well to get there.”</p>

<p>Jimmy bristled with anger as he heard the
voice. It was Rand’s. Jimmy’s rum-running
friend turned to him. “What about it? Shall I
take them over?”</p>

<p>“Not if you’re a friend of mine,” said Jimmy.
“This fellow is my worst enemy. He has played
me no end of dirty tricks, and I think he played
me one this very night.”</p>

<p>“Then I don’t take him,” said the bootlegger.
“Let him get to the island the best way he can.”</p>

<p>They turned away from the newcomers. Rand
was swearing furiously. But Jimmy paid no attention
to him and presently was beyond the
sound of his voice. Briefly he told his friend of
the difficulties he had had with Rand. “I’m just
as sure as I can be that now I know who sent that
second telegram here that pulled me down in the
bog and put my ship out of commission. I don’t
know what I am going to do, for I had expected
to fly out to the ship and get some photographs at
sunrise and then rush them to New York. The
local correspondents can finish up the story.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry about no pictures,” said the
rum runner. “I got my airplane all fixed up—new
motor and everything. She’s right at hand,
and come daybreak we’ll go git them pictures
and then start for New York. I got business
down that way and I’ll be glad to make the trip.
You done me a fine service once and I ain’t never
goin’ to forget it.”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:1.0em;'>Jimmy Triumphs Over Rand</p>

<p>When Jimmy and his lawless friend from
the border reached New York late the
next morning with the first photographs of the
wreck to arrive in that city and with some additional
facts about the wreck, the rum runner
wanted to say good-bye at once, but Jimmy
would not consent to this. He insisted that they
go see the managing editor. Finally the bootlegger,
whose name was LaRoche, agreed, and
early that afternoon the two met again at the
<span class='it'>Morning Press</span> building. They were at once admitted
to the managing editor’s office.</p>

<p>“Well, Jimmy, you seem to have had another
interesting adventure,” said Mr. Johnson, as he
welcomed his subordinate. “I’m mighty glad
you got out of it safe and sound.”</p>

<p>Jimmy introduced LaRoche to Mr. Johnson,
then said: “You speak of my having another
adventure, Mr. Johnson. What do you refer
to?”</p>

<p>“Why, to your trip out to the island through
the storm last night. I judge that was an experience
you won’t soon forget.”</p>

<p>“For me it was an adventure,” said Jimmy,
“though to Mr. LaRoche it was a very ordinary
experience, I judge. I shall not soon forget it.
Nor shall I forget the other adventure I had.”</p>

<p>“The other adventure! You speak in riddles,
Jimmy.”</p>

<p>Jimmy told his chief about the beacon in the
bog, about his landing in a swamp and being
hopelessly disabled, and about the two telegrams
received by the postmaster of Smithville.</p>

<p>While Jimmy was talking he could not fail to
notice the countenance of his chief. The most
extraordinary expressions followed one another
on the managing editor’s face. Interest, amazement,
concern, and finally an expression of angry
determination were all momentarily portrayed on
Mr. Johnson’s expressive countenance.</p>

<p>“Now I understand everything,” said he.</p>

<p>Jimmy waited for enlightenment.</p>

<p>“While you have been gathering a story of
heroism and death in the north,” said the managing
editor, “I have been picking up one of
cowardice and treachery here in New York. I
didn’t fully understand what it all meant until I
heard what you have just told me. Now I comprehend
it all. Your story and mine make a
beautiful mosaic. They dovetail together into a
completed tale. Would you like to hear <span class='it'>my</span> end
of that tale?”</p>

<p>Jimmy was all eagerness. “I can’t imagine
what you have in mind,” said Jimmy, “but of
course I want to hear about it.”</p>

<p>“Very well, here it is. Your friend, Mr. LaRoche,
will be interested, too. He has had some
small part in the story, too.”</p>

<p>Both the managing editor’s hearers looked their
astonishment.</p>

<p>“When you set out for Smithville last night,
Jimmy,” began the managing editor, “we did
everything we could possibly do at this end to
make your flight both safe and successful. I sent
you reluctantly. I knew flying conditions could
not be any too good in a region where a great
steamer had just been blown ashore. The fact is,
I was a little conscience-smitten, I guess. Your
narrow escape at Mingoville has been constantly
in my mind. But I allowed you to go—yes, I
even urged you to go—and after you had taken
off I began to worry about you and so I quite
naturally left nothing undone to insure the safety
of your trip.”</p>

<p>Both Jimmy and his companion were completely
mystified. They sat in silent expectation,
waiting for what was to follow.</p>

<p>“First of all,” continued Mr. Johnson, “I sent
Johnnie Lee over to your hangar. There was
nothing in particular for him to do except to be
there in case you should send back any radio messages
as you flew. You see, I have learned about
your Wireless Patrol and how skilful all you
boys are with the wireless. So it occurred to me
that Johnnie might be able to handle a radio conversation
better than almost anybody else on the
staff. Johnnie went over to the flying field immediately.”</p>

<p>The managing editor paused as though to
arrange his thoughts. After a moment he continued.
“Johnnie seems to be very wide awake.
He evidently nosed around the field and soon
learned that the <span class='it'>Despatch</span> man was having trouble
to get his plane into the air. The <span class='it'>Despatch</span>
no doubt received the flash about the wreck of the
lake steamer at the same time we got it. Its
plane should have taken the air as quickly as you
got aloft with our ship, Jimmy. But something
went wrong with it. An hour after you had departed,
the pilot and his mechanics were still
working desperately to get the ship into shape
to fly. Johnnie didn’t know what was wrong, and
of course he didn’t make inquiries in a rival’s
hangar. But he did discover that the reporter
who was to be flown in the plane was the fellow
he had seen at the coal mine disaster at Krebs.
He knew that the fellow had played you some
dirty tricks, and he decided he would keep an eye
on him.”</p>

<p>“You bet Johnnie would,” interrupted Jimmy.
“He’s a real friend.”</p>

<p>“Well,” continued the managing editor, “this
chap Johnnie was watching. Rand presently
went to the office in his hangar. Johnnie strolled
over that way and peeped in. Rand was standing
by a closet in the rear of the office. The door was
open only part way, but Johnnie could see that
Rand was talking into a telephone receiver that
stood on a shelf in this closet. This seemed queer
to Johnnie, because there on the desk was the
regular instrument. Johnnie tiptoed close to a
window, which was open a crack for ventilation.
He was in the dark and could not be seen. He
heard Rand say something about ‘skis on a
plane’ and ‘flying farther north from there.’
Johnnie of course couldn’t make anything out of
that, and quite naturally he never connected the
message with your flight.”</p>

<p>Jimmy drew a long breath. “I understand
the whole story now,” he said.</p>

<p>“Not quite, Jimmy. Let me go on. Rand
got off eventually and the force at Rand’s hangar
went home. Johnnie came back to our hangar.
But there wasn’t a thing to do, aside from making
frequent inquiries at the radio office, and he got
to wondering about that queer telephone he had
seen Rand use. So he picked up a flash-light,
slipped into Rand’s office, which was unlocked,
and went to the closet. It was locked. Johnnie
had his keys and with one of them was able after
a little effort to unlock the closet. There was the
telephone, on a separate wire, which came up
through the floor. You know how ramshackle
those hangars are. Well, Johnnie was able to
trace that wire. And where do you think it ran?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Jimmy.</p>

<p>“It was spliced to our own telephone wire. In
short, Rand had tapped the wire in our hangar,
so he could overhear our conversations.”</p>

<p>“Quite evident,” said Jimmy. “But what I
don’t understand is why Rand was <span class='it'>tallying</span> on our
wire. That would give him away, sure.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t have understood it either, had it
not been that I had occasion to talk to a Western
Union man. I had already arranged to have the
wire at Smithville opened for you, Jimmy, but
about three hours after you took off I had to call
the telegraph people again. And it was only by
the merest chance that the matter was mentioned
then. The fellow I was talking with remarked
that he had just come down from Canada and
that unless my reporter was going pretty far
north, he would have trouble landing on skis. I
didn’t know what he meant. That brought out
the fact that a second telegram had been sent
about the matter of a landing ground at Smithville.
I knew you had no skis on your plane now
and I said there must be a mistake about the message.
The telegraph official assured me that you
had sent a second message from Long Island.
When I checked up on the time the message was
sent, I saw right away what had happened. Some
one had sent a message in your name. We traced
the call and it came over our wire.”</p>

<p>The managing editor paused. “Please go on,”
said Jimmy, who was sitting tensely on the edge
of his chair.</p>

<p>“Well, I got in touch with Johnnie over at
the field. He had just ferreted out the secret
telephone wire. It was easy enough then to put
two and two together. But the thing that worried
me was the plight you were in, Jimmy. I
knew that unless you had had a mishap on the
way, you were already at Smithville. Whatever
was to happen had already happened. I got a
connection on the telephone with the postmaster
up there—the fellow you said you knew—and he
said you had gone out on the lake with Mr. LaRoche
here, and that nobody in the town expected
to see you come back alive. So you can
understand how anxious I was and how tremendously
pleased I was when your story began to
come in. By the way, Jimmy, what about your
plane? What is to be done about it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I have already arranged about that. The
plane isn’t really hurt any. The propeller is gone,
and maybe the undercarriage is damaged some.
But the ship itself is all right. I left directions
for the plane to be pulled out on firm land and
cleaned thoroughly. They are to wire me as
soon as this is done and tell me if anything is
needed. Then I shall go up there with my mechanic
and put on a new prop and make any other
repairs necessary. I don’t think the job will
amount to much.”</p>

<p>“You were mighty lucky, Jimmy, and we were
all tremendously relieved when we found you
were safe. Of course we are pleased about the
story. We scooped the town, as I suppose you
already know. But that was a small matter
alongside of your safety.”</p>

<p>“What I want to know,” said Jimmy, trying
to change the subject, “is what to do about Rand.
He is a poor loser. Every time I beat him he
tries some underhand work. What am I to do
about it? I could beat him up, and I once threatened
to do it; but that would not stop him from
attempting these dirty tricks.”</p>

<p>“Jimmy,” said Mr. Johnson, “you are not to
do anything about Rand. I will attend to that.
In fact, I have already attended to it. Here is
a letter I have written to him. In it I have told
him that we have absolute proof of his dirty work
that might well have cost you your life at Smithville.
What he did will without doubt constitute
a crime in the eyes of the law. I have told him as
much. I have also told him that unless he resigns
from the <span class='it'>Despatch</span>, gets out of newspaper work
entirely, and promises never again to attempt in
any way to interfere with you, I shall hale him
into court and stop at nothing until I see him
behind prison bars.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he will resign?”</p>

<p>“Jimmy, if this case ever went to court, and
we spread on the records all we know, not only
about this case but about other dastardly things
he has done, Rand would be so discredited that no
editor would ever again hire him, and he might
find it difficult to get a job of any sort whatever.
I’m mightily mistaken about Rand if he doesn’t
quit cold when he gets my letter. But if he
doesn’t, I shall proceed against him at once.”</p>

<p>Jimmy left the office both happy and sorry.
He was glad he was to be free from the competition
of such a man as Rand. He was sorry that
through him misfortune came upon another—even
Rand. He said as much to LaRoche.</p>

<p>“Forget, Kid,” replied the rum runner.
“You’re a square shooter clear through. Otherwise
I wouldn’t never have had nothin’ to do with
you. But this other fellow is only a rattlesnake.
You hadn’t nothing to do with his downfall. He
brought that on himself. And if it hadn’t come

<p>Jimmy walked with LaRoche to the latter’s
headquarters in a tough riverfront hotel. “You’ve
been a real friend to me,” he said. “I appreciate
it, I don’t know how to thank you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want no thanks. You’ve been my
friend. Don’t you suppose I like the friendship
of a kid as white as you are? When you get in
trouble again, let me know. You can always
count on Henri LaRoche.”</p>

<p>The rum runner held out his hand. Jimmy
shook it warmly. “Good-bye and good luck to
you,” he said.</p>

<p>At the end of the week Jimmy sauntered into
the office to get his pay. There was a notice
conspicuously posted on the bulletin board. He
stopped to read it. Then a great smile came over
his countenance, for this is what he read:</p>
